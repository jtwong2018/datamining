I am very easy going and laid back. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is. Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way I view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows. My word is always as good as gold and I never turn back on a promise. I am kind and compassionate and rarely say no when asked for help.The inner beauty is more important to me than the outer beauty, I like a bright and friendly personality and someone who is sincerely kind and not selfish. One of my favorite quotes\u201dLove isn\u2019t finding a perfect person. It\u2019s seeing an imperfect person perfectly.\nalternative description:\nI\u2019m versatile, self-aware. Straight forward person. I express myself appropriately. Non-violent, romantic, insightful, in tune and happy. I work full time. I live with the basic\u2019s. I will NEVER play games and EXPECT the same returned. I\u2019d like to thank you for \u201cviewing\u2019 my profile. Okay, about me. I like motorcycle riding. I have a decent job, small townhouse and a beautiful 8yo daughter. I have MANY hobbies and likes. Even my dislikes can be endured with a compatible partner. But commuting is a part of this life for now. I\u2019m an old-fashioned romantic, intelligent and have most of my ducks in a row. I am truthful, yet compassionate, I live a simplistic lifestyle and enjoy it. I try to be accommodating, understanding and thoughtful\u2026 but expect the same in return.\nwho I\u2019d like to meet. Okay you asked for it. I am searching for a partner. I am not a knight in shining armor, a savior nor do I have a broom to sweep you off your feet. I am a realist. Hollywood romance only occurs in Hollywood. I want a partner to have there life in order, looking for someone who will work with me to attain a goal of comfort, calmness, happiness, peacefulness and love. I will not do all the work NOR will I expect it to be done by themselves. WORK TOGETHER. I can cook, clean, iron, sew, vacuum, laundry etc (VERY domesticated) I can work in the yard, on my car/motorcycle and on the house. I expect help with all that. Taking care of children, again SHARED responsibility. Remember, it\u2019s not all about you or me\u2026 Us-We-Ours. If these words aren\u2019t included in you sentences, then I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be interested.", "email": " drewsjames@outlook.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "angelreturn", "badoo"], "gender": "male", "images": ["jamess11.jpg", "jamess12.jpg", "jamess13.jpg", "jamess14.jpg", "jamess15.jpg"]}
