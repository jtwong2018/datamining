I\u2019m big on almost anything that is legitimately fun, enjoyable, positive. I am also unconventional, independent, analytical and not very impressed with, nor attached to, all things money and status. To me, everyone is equal.\nI feel the \u2018solid realty\u2019 our minds show us is just one aspect of our overall being, or existence (and it is not as solid as it appears). In addition, each of us has a strong, positive spiritual aspect, or \u2018soul\u2019 (mine\u2019s my \u2018inner core\u2019). Our minds often overlook our spiritual aspect. However, my life experience has convinced me that it\u2019s real, very much right here, right now, very positive, equal in everyone, and not in any way linked to any religion or deity. I (almost) always try to live my life \u2018straight from my heart\u2019, what feels right to me IS RIGHT for me! It is a heavenly way to live. I\u2019m committed to putting this \u2018\u2026feels right IS RIGHT\u2019 life philosophy out there for anyone who may be interested..\ni am 6.0 in height, a widower. i have a 18years old daughter( Rose) \u2026A couple of year after the death of my wife.
