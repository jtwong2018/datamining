Let me say that I am a Saved and Reborn Again Christian. That is first and formost in my life. I have learned The Bible by many years of Christian Teachings thru radio Bible Ministries. I was married for almost the same amount of time I am now widowed. So I have seen, lived life on both sides. At this time in my life I am not wanting to travel extensively.. If you are after simple living, simple life pleasures, country living, watching nature, the woodlands, land creatures, sky gazing days or nights Then we will probably be a good match.", "email": " freddrickedmann8839@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["erd898381.jpg"]}
