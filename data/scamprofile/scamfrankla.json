I am looking for a woman to ruin her life with kindness. I am looking for what is in her heart & soul, not just the beauty of her skin, although some physical attraction is critical. I desire to find someone with great sense of humor and optimistic with life. I want to enjoy each day that life gives us together & live each day to its full potential. I do have faith in God.", "email": " frankforque4477@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["frankla1.jpg"]}
