I also want to be able to be Romantic to her with Love, not she tells me things she likes. If you love me, you will do this or that for me. I want to be able to do anything to make her happy, because I Love Her, not because she tells me to do it. Know what I mean, all i am looking for is real, true and pure Love and Hope you can make me feel real and new, pure and true Love because you sound very nice and sweet and you are someone i will never want to lose. Well as you know Exercise is very important and I generally try to live a somewhat healthy lifestyle, exercising and some sort of jogging, 3-4 days a week and eating healthy. Well not everyone loves sweets and candies but trust me, I love sweets and pastries, but try not to over do it.", "email": " james3gh@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["james1231.jpg"]}
