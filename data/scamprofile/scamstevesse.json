I am stepping back out into the scene to see what\u2019s out there. I have come to a point in my life where I want to have a woman by my side and all the happiness I can get from life. It is the most important quest for me right now; meeting that special someone and sharing our lives together. I dream of a strong harmonious relationship based on love, trust, spiritual closeness, mutual understanding and tranquility. I am seeking a kindred spirit, an equal someone, reliable partner and real lady who wants to have a good man and partner next to her, anytime, any-day for e-v-e-r. I\u2019ve realized what I want in a relationship, however, on the other hand, I understand it can be very fragile at times.\u00a0I am not interested in flings, friends with benefits, one night stands, neither am I the one to join a couple in bed. If your purpose here fall between any of the above listed or any related motive, please do NOT bother writing me. Good luck with your search! \ud83d\ude42\nlets text if interested", "email": " steve.castella@yandex.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "bigchurch", "connectingsingles", "dateolicious", "pof", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["stevesse1.jpg", "stevesse2.jpg", "stevesse3.jpg", "stevesse4.jpg"]}
