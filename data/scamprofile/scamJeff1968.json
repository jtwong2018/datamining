I am straightforward, strong willed, and therefore I don\u2019t smoke at all,I believe in treating others as I like to be treated; with kindness, courtesy, consideration, honesty, respect, etc. I do not judge others; that is up to God and I am not prejudice unless it comes to someones negative bad character and lack of respect, courtesy, kindness, honesty, etc. I view others through their eyes; the windows to their soul heart not through their physical features or attributes.
