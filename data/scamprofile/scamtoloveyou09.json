The more you love, the more you lose a part of yourself, yet you don\u2019t become less of who you are; you end up being complete with your loved ones..Live by the golden rule \u2013 do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Help at least one person each day and be kind to all you meet. I am not into games. I mean what I say. These are some values I have and look for in other people. I want someone i would spend some good, quality, fun time with, most of my life has been career oriented. I set career goals for myself and I have met those goals. I have a great job and i believe i have done very well for myself. I like to go shopping with women. I consider them my teacher. I am trying to break into being an entrepenuer and love to find out why women buy the things they want or need. That\u2019s the goal of alot of entrepenuers. So if someone needs a shopping buddy, then \u201cHit Me Up\u201d. I only show my love, and generosity. I am very much a practicing Christian. When I was 10yrs old, I prayed to god that I was giving Him total control over my life. The thing that I didn\u2019t realize (until later on) was that He already had total control over my life. He gives alot of people the choice of letting Him control their own lives. For me, He did not give me a choice. He took control over my life whether I liked it or not. In my mind I believe there is an afterlife. If you want to know why I believe that, then ask me. I\u2019ll tell you some real interesting things that happened. If you\u2019re interested, then hit me up!! .Now it is time to find that special someone. I hope I\u2019m not to late and there are some left!!", "email": " justinrush001@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "connectingsingles", "facebook", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["toloveyou091.jpg"]}
