I enjoy conversations that have depth, meeting new people, occasionally dancing the night away, and staying home while watching a good movie. I consider family and friends to be but a single family and I love them dearly. I hope to travel more when time permits, have deeper understandings of people, cultures, and of course myself. It\u2019s important to continue to better myself everyday.\nI\u2019m a passionate sports fan that enjoys a cold beer just as much as a good red wine, must be the Italian in me ;-). Oh yeah, I also like food which includes cooking on the grill. I study philosophy, history, enjoy singing a good song and spending time in nature when the temperature outside isn\u2019t as hot as the surface of the sun.\nSome would say that i\u2019m a good listener and am always interested in learning more about people. Being affectionate and compassionate are important aspects of myself and yes, that includes cuddling", "email": " johnbratline60@outlook.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "military scammer", "Sven"], "gender": "male", "images": ["cooldavidson331.jpg", "cooldavidson332.jpg", "cooldavidson333.jpg"]}
