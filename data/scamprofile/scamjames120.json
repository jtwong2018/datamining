My name is James. I\u2019m so excited to be here and I look forward to meeting someone to enjoy my favourite activities with, finding a roommate, finding a travel partner, finding a romantic partner and making new friends. I\u2019d love to tell you a bit about myself. In terms of my personality, I think I am ambitious, sensible, emotional, imaginative, flexible, fun and active. I like to think of myself as a truth teller, a warrior, a leader, a teacher, a lover of life, a risk-taker and a fun-lover. I also consider myself to be a career person, a nature lover, an urban explorer, a social butterfly and a rural lover.", "email": " jamesfoggo@hushmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["james1201.jpg"]}
