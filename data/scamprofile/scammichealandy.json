I\u2019m just a normal guy with a very good career doing what I love. I pay my bills,and have paid my dues as well. I enjoy doing things that are new and diffrent (at least for me) going places I\u2019ve never been and even better places I\u2019ve never heard of (that\u2019s where you come in). I\u2019ve spent my life trying to always do what I felt was the \u201cright\u201d thing. I don\u2019t have any time or patience for games, liars, cheaters, etc. Now I\u2019m looking for someone to share it with, You\u2019ll have to trust me on this but I don\u2019t do \u201cone way relationships\u201d you will be required to participate. Don\u2019t be shy. If this sounds like something you might be interested in please let me know. ( I sold my crystal ball for down payment on the Harley) Good-luck\nMicheal", "email": " michealandy55@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "netlog"], "gender": "male", "images": ["michealandy1.jpg"]}
