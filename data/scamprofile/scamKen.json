What you see is what you get. I\u2019m an open book with large print and lots of pictures. If the book is about me, it would be filled with photos of fond memories with family and friends, many of them from past golf, skiing, biking, wine and diving trips. The prose would be about the things that occupy my time, engage my mind and body and animate my life. Trouble is, brevity not being my strong suit, I can\u2019t do that in 4,000 characters or less (and I\u2019ve tried). That being the case, I will attempt to list them and hope that an image of me will emerge in your mind and a desire to write me note will emerge in your fingers. I believe that each one of us is an angel created by God with only one wing. It is our job to find the angel with the matching wing to truly fly as God has meant us to.", "email": " kengates12@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "facebook", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Ken1.jpg", "Ken2.jpg", "Ken3.jpg", "Ken4.jpg"]}
