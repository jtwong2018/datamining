I have a higher calling to impact generations, and I\u2019m doing just that. Not only in my work, but everyday, right where I am. I love children and can give up anything to see a smile on there face. I have dedicated my life to caring and protect for other people to make sure they rest while i protect them. I live in the moment but respect my past as a learning opportunity to become a better person. I don\u2019t take myself too seriously, and tend to be quick to forgive others. I must laugh daily to survive. Family is a very high priority to me. I tend to work more than play because I love what I do. I will leave a legacy to my children that will never be erased. God is my source for everything and I trust and love Him.", "email": " adaezeezumba@rocketmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["anderson1.jpg", "anderson2.jpg", "anderson3.jpg"]}
