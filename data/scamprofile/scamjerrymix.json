I feel strongly about enriching other people\u2019s lives, and value the same in return. You go around once, and I want to make every day count. I would enjoy having that special someone by my side to enjoy all that life has to offer, together. I\u2019m super active and love the outdoors, but equally enjoy cooking up a wonderful meal together and hanging out watching a nice movie, cuddled up with a great bottle of wine. I like to hike, love to ski and boat, and do outdoorsy things with my partner. I\u2019m creative and artistic. My interests listen to music, photography, wine, concerts (lots of concerts), dining, going to sporting events, going on wine trips, I think kissing should be an Olympic event. I\u2019m fun, fit, and funny. I put people at ease around me, I make them laugh, and I\u2019ve learned to not sweat the small stuff, as the saying goes. But I also pride myself on being educated, emotionally open and available, honest, stable, successful, well-dressed, I enjoy the finer things, I\u2019m stylish, I like to think I\u2019m sophisticated, but down-to-earth, playful and even silly sometimes, and I enjoy my partner to appreciate, and possess those qualities as well. I have always had a very strong work ethic and have had a solid career for over 30years now. I\u2019m a good man with a big heart. I\u2019m honest and reliable as a Swiss watch. I\u2019m a great friend, a good listener and communicator, and just want to enjoy my life to the fullest extent possible, with the right partner to \u201ccomplete me", "email": " Joeheart76@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "mingle2", "romance scammer", "starnow"], "gender": "male", "images": ["jerrymix1.jpg", "jerrymix2.jpg"]}
