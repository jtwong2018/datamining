Character is worth more than flashiness. I am a person who appreciates honesty and a great sense of humor. I love to laugh and to enjoy the simple things in life. I would appreciate a person who has a good sense of who he is and a sense of direction about where he wants to be. I can appreciate a man who sees a woman as a friend and a partner\u2026I know that men and women all have an inner child within and that is why I would appreciate days filled with fun and laughter. I respect and adhere to taking care of business in life, family, work and community, etc Yet, I know life involves balance. I look for the good in most situations and choose to look for the good in others. I like discovering new things. I am a person who looks for the possibilities versus what cannot be achieved. life is better going through with a special one instead of just any one. I like poetry I like trying new things. I respect the direct approach-that is saying what you mean and meaning what you say. I believe in smiling-even when things are not going as perfect as you had hoped. A smile can brighten someone\u2019s day-I liken smiling\u2013it is one of my trademarks\u2026 I feel all is not fair in love and war. That is, I feel you should give someone your best and that you should exercise respect and honesty.", "email": " lisa.umber@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "connectingsingles", "facebook"], "gender": "female", "images": ["chocolate7571.jpg", "chocolate7572.jpg", "chocolate7573.jpg"]}
