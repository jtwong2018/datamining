Lol! I am looking to date and develop a relationship. Laughter, love and happiness without any drama is the goal!\nI love the arts, music, movies, thrift stores, old cars and collecting mid-century stuff. I like going on road-trips, hikes, the dog park and the gym, but not a gym fanatic. I enjoy both being out on the town and being a homebody binge watching TV on the couch.\nI am a lips and eyes person\u2026I heard them say that eyes is the window of our soul\u2026 I love to gazed at those eyes that speaks to my heart without saying a word\u2026 I am drawn to smiling eyes\u2026 &amp; lips? And why lips? Because I\u2019m such a big fan of a Kiss\u2026 There is nothing in this world that can recreate the touch and the feeling of a long passionate kiss that would melt your heart\u2026\u2026I also enjoy lots of Hugs, talking, laughing, Holding hands, finding out that we have alot of things in common.", "email": " sarahleia1@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sarahleia11.jpg"]}
