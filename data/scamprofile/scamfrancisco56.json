I describe myself as: \u2018f 6\u2033 foot tall(1:85), 30 years of age, have a romantic build. I believe that love is not a crime i.e an accomplice is needed to love; but not all are willing to commit the crime of love. As for me, I live to love, to experience the magical feeling that love gives, to give my heart, my soul , my everything. I long to live my life for something worth while{ love }for it is like oxygen, the very essence of life. Much time is wasted on frivolities and trivialities and chasing after the wind and if there\u201ds one lesson i have learned in life, it is that u got to make d most of everything for life in itself is never ending and coming to love is what makes life eternal. Indeed, the greatest lesson is to love and be loved. So, i crave that, i want it, i desire it; if for just a moment, then my life wouldn\u2019t have been a waste. Life is too short to be chained to an unloving heart and if there\u201ds little love anywhere on the planet, i can travel the length to seek and find it. I am young @ heart but puts no barrier to love. I only seek to find the one who appreciates the \u201clittle and big things\u201d i have to give. So i keep hoping , as i know the best things in life either come too soon or too late{ i pray for soon though} but never @ the time we expect .", "email": " floresfrankie56@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "badoo", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["francisco561.jpg", "francisco562.jpg", "francisco563.jpg", "francisco564.jpg", "francisco565.jpg", "francisco566.jpg"]}
