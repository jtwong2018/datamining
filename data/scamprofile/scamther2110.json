Also I am a good listener and open-minded understanding person. I really believe in equality between a man and a woman. We share the burdens and the joy in our life together and there is nothing we cannot speak about. For this reason I want to be completely open. If need only an obedient housewife slash slave\u2026 that is probably not me, sorry. But I want you to look deeper: I am not afraid to commit, I am kind-hearted, generous, caring, passionate and sympathetic young lady who is seriously looking for her soulmate to start a family with.", "email": " theressm155@hotmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "Angie Varona"], "gender": "female", "images": ["ther21101.jpg"]}
