I guess the best way to put it is that I am a genuine person with a huge heart. I am family oriented and I am looking for someone with strong family values. I am looking for a lady in the whole extension of the word, selfconfindent, very intelligent, who has strong and clear values and ideals, compatible with mine, of course and, most of all, with whom I could have an excellent communication, free of obstacles, totally open and based on the mutual confidence; a solid relationship, in which there exists intimacy and mutual knowledge of our feelings, capacities, limits, etc.. In other words, I think I am just looking for someone to share my life with. Feel free to email me if you are interested, and let embark on a blissful jorney of love, friendship and companionship.", "email": " rickybrain18@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "okcupid", "romance scammer", "someonenew"], "gender": "male", "images": ["rickybrain181.jpg"]}
