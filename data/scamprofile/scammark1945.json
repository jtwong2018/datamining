I\u2019m not tall, I\u2019m not dark, but I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m handsome. I\u2019m down to earth. Shy at first, very simple and liberal person. Life is way to short to sweat the small stuff. I\u2019m looking for a long-term relationship or marriage. I\u2019m not afraid of commitment. I will compliment you when the time is right. I don\u2019t have a problem telling you when I like something. Even if it\u2019s a friendly compliment. I\u2019m a very good listener.", "email": " marksterlin1945@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["mark19451.jpg", "mark19452.jpg", "mark19453.jpg", "mark19454.jpg"]}
