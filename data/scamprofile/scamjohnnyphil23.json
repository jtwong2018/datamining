I am one who strongly believes in respect and that without respect, you can\u2019t experience true love and generate a healthy relationship. I believe in a smaller \u201cwow\u201d when it is first a friendship and then a larger \u201cWow\u201d later as it evolves into a Beautiful Loving committed relationship. I believe it\u2019s not just what you are like on the outside, but more about what you are like on the inside. I\u2019m seeking friendship first, (no game playing please) with someone who appreciates some of the same temperaments and interests I enjoy.\nI have witnessed a lot about life and that has kept me moving and gave me greater hopes and vision.", "email": " johnnyphil888@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "dateolicious", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["johnnyphil231.jpg"]}
