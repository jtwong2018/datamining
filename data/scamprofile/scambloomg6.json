I really appreciate warmth and genuine caring, love and peace. I enjoy rhapsodic melodies that flow with harmony and send waves of pleasure through my mind. I adore infectious laughter, it brightens my world and invigorates my soul.I passionately appreciate uninhibited writing that explores emotions and stimulates my thoughts. I have the heart to express true love and trust. My wish is to have a good and pleasant long term relationship. The most important thing is faithfulness and respect. Nice time with friends as well as time alone for balance and reflection, finding new experiences, and still searching for the one to share with. I am a very kind and loving person who is looking for someone who is willing to let me be myself and loves me for who I am. I have much to offer someone who is willing to take a leap of faith. I consider myself loyal and honest and am looking for someone who shares those values. I enjoy seeing new things and experiencing life. I also enjoy just relaxing with someone special.", "email": " donaldpatterson687@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "match"], "gender": "male", "images": ["bloomg61.jpg"]}
