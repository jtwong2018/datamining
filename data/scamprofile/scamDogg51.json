You will have your heart broken probably more than once and it\u2019s harder every time. You\u2019ll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You\u2019ll fight with your best friend. You\u2019ll blame a new love for things an old one did. You\u2019ll cry because time is passing too fast, and you\u2019ll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you\u2019ve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness you\u2019ll never get back. I love hot weather but don\u2019t like the sun. I hate cold weather but like snow. I love the rain. I like my food at room temperature. I am a lifelong stutterer and found a love and talent for writing early in my life. I love nature and everything in it.", "email": " thomas5050@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Dogg511.jpg"]}
