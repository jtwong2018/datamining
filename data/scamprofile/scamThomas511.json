I have got some flaws and eccentricity that make me like every other human being as imperfect. Life is not a bed of roses, but full of thorns, ruggedness and anxiety. Life is sweet when you give yourself a chance to enjoy it, I live everyday as if it was my last by enjoying it to its fullest. I value monogamy, commitment and integrity. I love to read, learn about anything and everything; explore new things and places; I love to laugh and have been told I have good sense of humor. I am full of beans and adventurous when you get to know me. I have a lot to say about myself but I have to be concise, the rest you will find out when we eventually start corresponding,am sure i will find that special someone .", "email": " thomasambrose10@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Thomas5111.jpg"]}
