I\u2019m a very nice guy and I\u2019m looking fore a nice girl In my spare time I enjoy having a nice family and friends with who I like to spend time with\u2026 But I\u2019m not satisfied, because I\u2019m not happy\u2026 if you are really interested in me get me on /yours for love/ join it together then get me on face bo oK I need someone to share life with. Share the small every day experiences as well as the big adventures. Someone to laugh with, to cuddle, to surprise, to make happy and to kiss. When you have someone to go through life with, the positives in life get more positive, and the negatives get less negative. As a person I\u2019m honest and open. I cannot keep things inside and hide my emotions. Sometimes that comes with a risk of being rejected, but that\u2019s okay, because it\u2019s who I am. Besides this, I\u2019m a loving man and there are no limits to what I will do for people I love and care about. I\u2019m convinced that the girl I\u2019m seeking has a big emphatic heart and cares for people around her. In a relationship she likes to surprise and treat others, like myself, because I have a big need to feel loved and cared for; both verbally as well as physically. Besides this, she also value a good an open communication.", "email": " daniel4cares1@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "Kevin Rockwood"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Daniel1.jpg"]}
