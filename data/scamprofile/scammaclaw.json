I am down to earth and love to have fun and be adventurous\u2026 love to laugh (good sense of humor) I enjoy all sorts of activites, including surfing, visiting museums, taking long walks, as well as watching movies. I am kind, considerate, and generous. I am also brutally honest and speak my mind. I enjoy laughing and making others laugh. I also like to sing along with the song on the radio (sometimes badly) and dance around my living room. I stun people with my creativity.I used to be a Trekkie. I like to bake and love sugar. I want to build a go-kart. I like to wear casual, comfortable clothes. I never wipe my mouth on my sleeve \u2013 my nose is another story. Simple things amaze me. I don\u2019t do windows. I love to watch thunderstorms. I firmly believe that chocolate is a necessary tool to survive in this world. I believe there is life on other planets.
