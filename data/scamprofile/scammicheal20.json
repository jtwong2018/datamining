I am loving, passionate and compassionate. I don\u2019t let too much get me down. I love to laugh and look at the bright side of life. I hope someday that I will meet the love of my life. I want to love and be loved. To share my life in a positive nurturing relationship. I am not into games and drama. So please don\u2019t bring it. I was abandoned at a very young age. I have a past that is not pretty. I am very street smart and never dwell on my past. I am very thankful every day for my life and my health. I could look back and hate and be bitter, but I have found that my past has made me who I am and I like who I am. I choose to love and inspire over hate. Life is so very short to not live with love in your heart every minute of everyday.", "email": " michealleonard316@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "matchdoctor"], "gender": "male", "images": ["micheal201.jpg"]}
