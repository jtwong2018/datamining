I have high expectations for myself and give 100% when I commit to a project. Every day is a new adventure for me and I wake up each morning with a smile. I am dedicated & faithful to the one I love. I like to throw in a little imagination and fantasy into reality. I feel it helps with spontaneity and keeps things lively. I enjoy going out or staying in, but I\u2019m definitely more on the go these days than not. I believe resilience, independence, curiosity and spunk are essential parts of my personality. I have some family responsibilities My career involves gathering group of people from different race and with different faiths so I understand and care for them greatly. I enjoy being with someone who brings out the best in me and I will bring out the best in you. Relationships should not just be about me, or you, but US, if you want something significant. If you are ready for an incredible man and think you can keep up, then I am definitely someone you should meet. If you consider yourself intelligent, nice-looking, funny, and adventurous, I have been looking for you. I want?\u2026Well, hmmm\u2026Honesty! Faithfulness! Chemistry! If there is true chemistry the rest should fall into place\u2026.Ok, It doesn\u2019t matter what your body type is. I don\u2019t care if you have hair or not.
