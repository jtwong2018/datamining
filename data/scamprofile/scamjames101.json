I like to make other people happy, there is nothing more fulfilling than bringing laughter or a smile to someone\u2019s face. I have been told that I have a great sense of humour, but you will have to judge that yourself if i am or not. I would describe myself as being rather quiet almost shy when meeting new people, but open up rather quickly once I get to know you. As food is needed for the body, them same way love is needed for the soul. Food strengthens the body while love strengths the soul. A person is incomplete without love. Love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It\u2019s not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end. I am a great listener and always there for my friends when they need me.I am soft, Handsome and gentle Man, like when in the house warmly and cosy.. I believe in the God and in the soul. I love walks on nature, I adore fresh whiff of a wind, tender beams of the gentle sun. I am looking to build a relationship, which is based on trust, integrity, honesty and lots of romance. I am looking for marriage and life full of happiness. I dream to meet a woman who love children and respect family traditions. I would like to let you know up front I\u2019m not looking for just a pen-pal, I would like to find someone that I can share life with to enjoy the good time and be there for in the tougher times. I think that I\u2019m a good person and will be able to make someone happy.", "email": " noreenjames68@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "meetme"], "gender": "male", "images": ["james1011.jpg"]}
