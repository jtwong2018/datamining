I think it is important to exercise and eating very healthy meals. I love to go out dancing, to nice romatic dinners and shopping at large malls like the Mall of America. I enjoy romantic music and slow dancing as well an fast dancing. I prefer romantic, attractive, affectionate women.. I believe that romance is a very important part of the relionship. I enjoy men who are confident with themselves and are not afraid to express themselves in a diplomatic way. I think it is very important that two people want the same thing in a relationship. I believe that this should be discussed and communicated clearly when two people first meet. I do not believe in wasting my time or the other persons time because life is too short. I believe each person should be allowed to be who they are and to be free to give their best for each others mutual benefit..", "email": " romanice_cathy@outlook.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "facebook", "love scammer", "Megan Salinas"], "gender": "female", "images": ["romanice1.jpg", "romanice2.jpg"]}
