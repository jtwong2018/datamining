I\u2019m a Romantic at heart but don\u2019t take it for granted. I can be very intense, bold, & Assertive so I am not weak at heart, however I can be sweet, patient & caring but as i said don\u2019t take it for granted or you\u2019ll see the other side. I\u2019m very deep, knowledgeable & I do say what\u2019s on my mind, i might sound like a know it all and conceited but I\u2019m not i can be pretty humble based on what I\u2019ve been through. I can be intense with exploring my emotions but I\u2019m not going to fall in love with you overnight ( unless we connect spiritually like that) because i believe in getting to know someone through friendship.I\u2019m just sick of games people play. I like a womanwho knows what she wants and is not about the games and drama. i sometimes feel like giving up because to me there are no longer any good men left, women today have forgotten what being a woman means and to let a man be a man,i have to thank god for keeping me strong enough to keep my fate and believing in unconditional love. I want to lay around talking about life, love, and spiritual happiness.I want to go on picnics.and long strolls in the park\u2026I want to lay on the beach at night looking up at the stars wrapped in the arms of that special someone. I want to explore nature, love, & kindred spirits.I don\u2019t want you to change who you are for me and I don\u2019t want to change who I am for you.compromise is good but let\u2019s just be who we are.you should get back to me if you found my profile interesting to you.I want you to strive to be the best you can be\u2026 & you should want me to simply do the same.and when we are in our purest form & honest about who we are if we are meant to be well.we will be.and I will be perfect for you & you for me! this is me in my purest truest sense\u2026 take it or leave it.I\u2019ve had my past experiences with relationship and within myself and it opened my eyes to so much I needed to see, It was like a bright light of inspiration,a plunging reality into my heart & soul.bringing enlightenment to my spirit. It reminded me of the passion for life I\u2019ve always had and loved\u2026an intense passion I want to share with someone. So i don\u2019t want someone to talk to me just because they think I\u2019m cute or Handsome.", "email": " watson.delle009@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Wat4her1.jpg", "Wat4her2.jpg", "Wat4her3.jpg"]}
