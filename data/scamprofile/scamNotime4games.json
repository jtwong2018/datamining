There are so many things in life to enjoy and share. Quiet time is as important to me as learning and experiencing new things. Cuddling in front of a movie, listening to music or sitting on the shore of an ocean watching the waves crash with someone I care for is about as healing as it gets. Just sitting quietly and listening without the feeling that we have to keep up a conversation \u2026it is a very comforting feeling. I tend to be self-reliant and do not enjoy depending solely on others. I try to be objective in decision making and not let emotions bias my decisions. I am open and honest in my communication and do not like to leave issues to smolder. I would rather bring problems into the open to discuss and resolve.", "email": " callisto303@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "Steve Jones"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Notime4games1.jpg", "Notime4games2.jpg", "Notime4games3.jpg"]}
