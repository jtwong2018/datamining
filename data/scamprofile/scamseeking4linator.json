I believe the experiences we have and the relationships in our life far outweigh chase for material gain.I am extremely affectionate and still believe in true romantic Love.\nI am hoping to meet someone who shares similar but not exact ideals because I believe we can learn from each other and that we continue to grow and evolve through out our lives.I don\u2019t box myself into my own little world and neither should you.\nMy interests are varied and many and I love in depth conversation.We don\u2019t need to agree on everything because debate is a good thing.I believe past is gone and you can\u2019t change it,thus,you should be ready to forge into the future as I am.I don\u2019t want to hear everything that went wrong in your past relationships and I won\u2019t bore you with mine.
