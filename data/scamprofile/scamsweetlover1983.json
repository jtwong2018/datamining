I like to find out new things and find new emotions in life. I believe that everything is possible in our life, we only need to have desire for something, and reach our goal. Now my goal is to find a partner for life and I would do all I can to find that only one right person for me.\nI have read that butterflies can fulfill our dreams and they bring them to heaven. That is why we should not catch them and stop them on their way. I wonder if I were a butterfly what wish errand you would give to me? Perhaps I can do that. I like to help people and to be outdoors, I like flowers a lot too. And bright dresses. I am just an extraordinary girl just wishing to be happy.", "email": " rachaeladams5001@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sweetlover19831.jpg"]}
