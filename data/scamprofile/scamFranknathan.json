I have a friendly sense of humor already knowing that\u2026 no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a friend to act goofy with. I am a single father. i like social outings and adventures as it keeps me going. All i really want is someone who can give out so much love to that special man in her life, should be Intelligent, honest and responsible. Someone who is positive and believes that every day holds something amazing, should have the ability to share her heart and her mind. I am serious about sharing my life with someone and it won\u2019t be as a playmate and she needs to be ready to make a commitment if the relationship matures. I am not actually looking for perfection but seeking for an Ideal relationship.", "email": " franknathan98@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Franknathan1.jpg"]}
