I enjoy dining out or cooking at home with family & friends. I have a diverse tastes in music and movies and always interested in trying something new. I have enjoyed traveling and experiencing different countries and cultures and living abroad. Still lots of places I want to experience ! I enjoy meeting open minded people who enjoy exploring new places and trying new things. Anyone who is easy-going, sociable, and loves to laugh will get along great with me. I am caring ,generous (to a fault), honest as the day is long, affectionate and respectful of others. I am a bit old fashioned in regard to things like romance,opening the door for someone or expressing my gratitude for acts of kindness from others. I like to exercise often and try to stay fit.", "email": " bryolson@outlook.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Bryolson1.jpg"]}
