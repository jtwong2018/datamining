No relationship of any kind can exist without trust\u2026What we are, is our Gift from GOD. And what we become, is our Gift to GOD.A relationship with no trust is like a cell phone with no service, all you can do is play games.\nwell no matter the distance apart, if you are meant to be together, in the end, you will find yourselves together; if you don\u2019t give up on each other.I don\u2019t care about age difference I am more concern about the heart and i believe so much in chemistry.I am seriously looking for someone i can spend the rest of my life with.am looking for a man that know what he want in life a generous man.Even if you\u2019re far from each other, if your hearts are connected, distance will only be numbers.", "email": " sukanmilaye22@outlook.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "connectingsingles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["oluwatade221.jpg", "oluwatade222.jpg"]}
