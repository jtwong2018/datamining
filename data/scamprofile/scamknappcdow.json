I am very independent, but still enjoy a woman who believes in me opening doors and pulling out chairs.What do I want in a great (but not perfect) match? Kindness, honest communication, a sense of humor and lots of affection. I find intelligence very attractive and I believe that who we are is more important than what we can do. You will have your hobbies and I will have mine. It is important to find some common ground and share hobbies, but it\u2019s more important to me to learn about you as a person. One day we will not be able to climb Mt. Everest and jump out of airplanes!:-), so knowing and\nunderstanding each other, and being able to be together is what it\u2019s really all about!\nI do have a serious side. In a world where kindness, honesty and doing the right thing seem to have taken a back seat, I am proud to report that I am still sitting in the front. These values are very important to me and I would like to find someone who shares them.Do you enjoy traveling? It\u2019s definitely on my bucket list. I would love to travel to places where I can see both history and the present culture of our world.Music is my passion. I play everything from blues to Jethro Tull to classical to soul. I played in a band for seven years and really miss it. Maybe a classic rock band is in my future.I am still a pretty good cook!", "email": " knapp5565@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["knappcdow1.jpg"]}
