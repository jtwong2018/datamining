I can be serious but I also have a great sense of humor and I don\u2019t sweat the little things. I\u2019m a honest, trustworthy, loyal, fun loving compassionate energetic spontaneous dependable woman. I am looking to create memories with that special guy. A guy committed to building a secure fulfilling life together. A guy with the sense of acknowledgment of the finer things in life also the more enlightening aspects of a relationship. He should be able to show his feelings express them at any given moment. I am looking for someone that is loving, thoughtful and devoted to the relationship. We are separate people who make an excellent couple. I want their face to light up when i walk into the room as mine will when they do. I like to be casual but have no problem dressing up. I love out-door activites but it doesn\u2019t take first place in my life. I like camping, floating, fishing, and mushroom hunting. I enjoy going to concerts, movies, flea markets, and antique stores. I believe a couple should be individuals that make a great couple. I am looking for that special guy that wants to share our lives together. I want that special feeling that happens when we walk into a room and we each light up upon seeing each other. The person that no matter how bad your day was it all goes away when were together.", "email": " zlitcdop@6paq.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "connectingsingles", "okcupid", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["SoullFinder301.jpg", "SoullFinder302.jpg", "SoullFinder303.jpg", "SoullFinder304.jpg"]}
