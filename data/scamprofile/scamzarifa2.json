I study English, Polish and History, those subjects are connected with my interests but generally I\u2019m interersted in much more things. Then I hope to gratuade and study something realated at the university. Maybe museology? I don\u2019t know now. I have a few plans. I spend my free time mostly writing letters, drawing, writing stories, reading books, watching tv series or playing games. I\u2019m here to meet penpals with common interests. Addicted to tea, tumblr and music. I\u2019m typical introvert, INFJ (check out my type, it really describes me well) and sometimes nerdy af.
