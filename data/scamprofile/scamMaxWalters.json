You could say that I am one of the few people who enjoy their job, I can honestly admit that I adore my job and have a strong drive to achieve better by providing outstanding care and empathy to my patients. Ever since I was a little boy, I have always dreamed of becoming a doctor and I made this dream into reality when I grew up. The best feeling in the world is seeing my patients recover and become healthy and confident individuals once again. I would definitely describe myself as a confident, caring, thoughtful, loving, perceptive and spontaneous man. I lead a busy life, my job is very demanding both physically and mentally, home life is equally busy because there is always stuff to be done, why put off until tomorrow what can be done today is one of my mottos in life. After heart break, I healed myself through work and concentrated on gaining experiences and further qualifications. However, I am now ready to take the backseat and remind myself what it is to feel like a man once again. I am full of desire and passion and I need to release it to a woman who will appreciate my kindness and honesty.", "email": " princeapau99@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["MaxWalters1.jpg"]}
