Everybody does both, but most waiver on one-side. Some take what they can to feed thier souls making thier lives a better place, others give to feed thier souls, leaving our planet a better place. Don\u2019t get me wrong I too am looking for quality of life, but don\u2019t need someone to create it for me. I want someone to share it with. I\u2019m here for the same reasons you are.Im looking for someone to share and enjoy lifes journeys with. When I was younger I sometimes listened without comfirming. This meant a lot of things that wern\u2019t true, but sounded like they could be were just considered true. Classic one that Im sure you\u2019ve all heard is \u201cOpposites attract\u201d. Yes, they do because you admire qualities in people that you don\u2019t posses urself. This makes them different and interesting.
