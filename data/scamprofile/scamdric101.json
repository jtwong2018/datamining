I am willing to take my relationship very serious and to the next level but just wish I could find my soulmate, someone to love, cherish and adore all the days of my life.\nI am looking for someone who is open and sincere that is ready for a long term relationship. She should be friendly, caring, loving with good sense of humor.", "email": " davrick701@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "loveawake"], "gender": "male", "images": ["dric1011.jpg"]}
