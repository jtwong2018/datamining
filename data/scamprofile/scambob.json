With that said I don\u2019t think any of us can really describe ourselves in a few paragraphs, at least I know I can\u2019t, so the best thing to do is take a chance; if you want to know something ask\u2026 drop me a line. I don\u2019t bite\u2026. hard. * grins* But lets cover the basics\u2026 Big thing you should know is I am not in need of paxil or any mood altering meds. I am not insane, psycho or a stalker. That alone, I have probably lost half of you reading this. LOL LOL Me in a nutshell, I\u2019m me. I decided to ask my friends about me, ha who better, right? Here is what they said, I am laid back, down to earth, too smart for my own good. I\u2019m always laughing at one thing or another (I promise I don\u2019t snort). I\u2019m very classy, well mannered, but behind closed doors, I relax.I\u2019m loyal to a fault to those that earn my respect. I\u2019m very respectful and polite at all times, until you give me a reason to not be. I\u2019m very passionate about certain things, and far too honest for my own good. PLEASE take this to heart because I am honest to a fault\u2026 Don\u2019t ask unless you really want to know. I\u2019m very pointed in everything that I do. I have been told I could have fun at an insurance seminar. I\u2019m always learning. I can be very rough and tumble.I\u2019m not high maintenance. I am very ambitious and I have goals. I am very active and always doing something. So that about sums it up. I\u2019d like to establish friends and then take it from there. I believe any relationship friends or otherwise is based on 4 things, trust, honesty, respect, and communication, if you don\u2019t have these then you are wasting your time. I\u2019m Not looking for an internet thing or to text 24/7, I hate texting. I do have a child and he comes first. PERIOD, he and I are actually friends still. The reality is we all have a past and we all have scars, it is what comes when you live fully. It means you take a chance and you get hurt, it\u2019s life. However it is what we do with the scars that defines us. You can live or be a victim, there is no in between. I am not into drugs at ALL this is non negotiable. I really have to warn you I have NO tolerance for liars of any kind, and not telling me is lying by omission. If you\u2019re separated or married, I\u2019m not interested. You\u2019re still married. I take that seriously. If your looking to be plugged into TV or games 24/7, or sit and text 24/7, I\u2019m not right for you. If you want someone to tell you what to do, I\u2019m not going to be what you are looking for. Game players, drama queens and emotastic folks, I don\u2019t have the patience for it.", "email": " yonkers229@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio"], "gender": "male", "images": ["bob1.jpg", "bob2.jpg", "bob3.jpg"]}
