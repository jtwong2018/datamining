I try to remain as humble as possible. I\u2019m no saint by any means but It is important to me. I love children,I\u2019m childlike, love to laugh and joke, keep things light and count my blessing. I don\u2019t drink much, but don\u2019t hold it against any one who does, It\u2019s their choice and I don\u2019t judge them, just want them to be themselves. Let\u2019s talk. But at this point in my life I\u2019m waiting for the total package,a companion, friend and a loving woman.\nl am a kind and fun-loving person who wishes to meet someone with those same qualities. I would like someone who is passionate about life and wants to take it to it\u2019s fullest, someone who cares about other people, someone who enjoys spending time with and showing affection to their partner, someone who likes to pamper and be pampered, and someone who likes to laugh.", "email": " richard_miller05@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "datingbetter", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["richy05051.jpg"]}
