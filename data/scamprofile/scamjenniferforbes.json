I am seeking my special one, my soulmate. My man is kind, honest, faithful, loves me as I am, respects me and my family and he is my best friend. I do want to find a man who I can trust, who keeps his word and who I can rely upon in every situation. Perhaps I\u2019m a little old-fashioned, but I like to believe that marriage, for better or for worse is sacred for life. That\u2019s why I am here to find my special one and to build a happy and strong family with him! I am romantic but at the same time I am not up in the clouds. I am honest and I know how to compromise. I can listen and hear. You won\u2019t be bored with me ever as I always will find a way to cheer you up. I am active and like to take good care of myself; to make my body shaped and my mind sharp.", "email": " jenniferforbes432@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["jenniferforbes1.jpg"]}
