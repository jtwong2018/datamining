My mood is always good, because I am very optimistic. It can be strange, but yes \u2013 you can be sure I am a person who smiles all the time and do not even think about bad things. So, that is my type! To open my soul, if you look inside, you can see a very kind girl with a mild character. I am very real and sometimes it brings me much harm, but that is life. I have a very positive attitude to everything and if I am here \u2013 it means I am lucky to have a chance to meet you.", "email": " elizabethleibi@mail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sweetelizabeth1091.jpg"]}
