Not afraid to open up and express my feelings with the right person. Willing to try almost anything at least once but at the same time have a particular taste. Love to go out but just as comfortable being at home. I tend to look at things from all angles and pull things apart in hopes of discovering. I believe no one should be closed off to the idea of broadening oneself. The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved, loved for ourselves, or rather loved in spite of ourselves.Naturaly I would like to meet a woman who\u2019s equally sensitive, who\u2019s open-minded and growth-oriented, is smart in either an educated or a \u201clife experience\u201d way, and who enjoys some of the same things. These include reading, traveling, loving nature, photography, staying in or going out to see movies, dining out, savoring a fine wine and some cheese, walking and exploring the oceans and beaches. But I\u2019m focusing on the positive after a long marriage and looking forward to the next fulfilling chapter in my journey.", "email": " van_nmey@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["aleksiewicz1.jpg", "aleksiewicz2.jpg", "aleksiewicz3.jpg", "aleksiewicz4.jpg", "aleksiewicz5.jpg", "aleksiewicz6.jpg", "aleksiewicz7.jpg", "aleksiewicz8.jpg", "aleksiewicz9.jpg"]}
