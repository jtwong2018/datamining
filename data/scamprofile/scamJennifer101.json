Always treat people the way I like to be treated. There is so ME, I have a great appreciation for the beauty of people and things. I strive to create balance and harmony between others and myself. I know that life is a journey with each new day presenting challenges and situations designed to create the person we were meant to be.and honesty is paramount. Romantic love is not a fantasy but it is the responsibility of the partners to ensure that the fire burns bright. I still believe in hearts and flowers; candlelight and wine; walks in the park or along the beach; and \u201canytime\u201d rendezvous. I have a passion for music and travel. Vacations that combine these activities are most enjoyable for me. I am a voracious reader and you will probably find me alone with a book more often than in front of the television. I am a sports fanatic,and I do enjoy basketball, and bicycling. Activities that keep me in touch with the natural \u2013 earth, air, water are most pleasurable for me.", "email": " jenniferturner2900@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Jennifer1011.jpg"]}
