It\u2019s not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end.Love is blind but after experiencing it for a long time you should become familiar with some particular spots.Love is a precious gift that you receive, and you need to give it with caution..Love is happiness given back and forth.Love is a noble act of self- giving, offering trust, faith, and loyalty. The more you love, the more you lose a part of yourself, yet you don\u2019t become less of who you are; you end up being complete with your loved ones.Relationships are like being branded,", "email": " Debbiefrw@protonmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Debbie1230001.jpg"]}
