They have all been taken already unless i make some new ones. lol! I love to have fun when I am around people and when I am home I am pretty much Mr. Chill. God knows my wants and needs because He knows everything. I want someone to spend my life with someone to share a life with. Someone who loves me for me. Even my weird nerdy like tendencies, My moodiness at times cause yea I\u2019m a Pisces, a best friend, a soulmate. Someone to sings songs with because sometimes a song come on and you just want to sing it, I don\u2019t like to focus on the negative. I offer you my heart and soul to that one person who wants it and shows me they need it. Wait only God can have our souls. : ) If i am lucky enough to have your heart I will cherish it forever. I am down to earth, I am loving and caring, honest and loyal, Passionate and affectionate.
