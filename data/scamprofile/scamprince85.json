I am independent and ready to find an serious Lady who is secure with herself and enjoys what they do as much as I do. I only wish to better myself by sharing my life with someone that I can call my best friend and have fun living life with. I enjoy parks, and the beach, and hanging out with friends. Bon fires and more, camping and traveling to different places . I enjoy crafts and have a passion for flower arrangements. My favorite times of the year are spring for the green leaves and the flowers I get to plant and the misty rain showers, summer for the suntan and free time it allows me, fall for the smell in the air, the beautiful scenery and of course Halloween, winter for that first snow and the crackling fire in the fireplace. I enjoy my son and am amazed at how fast he is growing up and how soon it will be before he\u2019s gone on his own.
