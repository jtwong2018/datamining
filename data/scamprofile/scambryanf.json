I am also passionate about my career, personal goals and seeing my dreams come true. I am also a believer in Karma and \u201cwhat is meant to be will be\u201d. There is a romantic in me that enjoys being spontaneous and doing the little things that matter. For fun I enjoy: traveling, performing arts, cooking, feature films and art galleries. Having a glass of wine, watching a sunset, and spending time with friends & family are all great too. I stay in great shape with a variety of activities. Lastly, I am genuine and mean what I say.
