He is someone who would jump out of bed in the middle of the night to help someone in need and never expect the same in return. He has a great career and understands the value in working hard and being professional. In his spare time you\u2019d find him on the slopes, hiking the mountains, running and/or riding the foothills, taking in a movie or finding live music to get lost in. Overall\u2026a great man and great catch \ud83d\ude42 From my perspective I\u2019m all that and more! I value friendships and family and have a positive outlook on life. I\u2019ve leaned the importance of communication in a relationship, it\u2019s importance and how it can bring two people together. I believe a relationship is a true partnership\u2026two people together, sharing, being open and honest, knowing they have each other back, both equally involved to keep a healthy balance. I love being active and keeping fit\u2026it\u2019s good for the body and the mind! Have had the pleasure of completing many triathlons\u2026two of them being Ironmans\u2026and hope to finish one more long distance event as the goal was always three. The sport has taught me that we all have it in us if we try hard enough and, that in the end, it\u2019s well worth it. I take that knowledge into a relationship\u2026if two people truly care for each other then they will be together no matter how difficult life may be! I\u2019m a very affectionate and open individual who is comfortable in his own skin. I stay active and love the outdoors, though quiet evenings and lazy Sunday afternoons can be just as enjoyable. I\u2019ve traveled all over the country and Canada for my career and am now settled full time in Canada. Even after spending the past few years on the road I still enjoy the weekend get away and I look forward to taking a week long vacation once a year", "email": " berthra_geeslin@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "fishmeetfish"], "gender": "male", "images": ["love_cute151.jpg"]}
