I don\u2019t know much about fashion, but I\u2019m willing to accept (and probably badly need) feminine help. I\u2019m only vain about my blue eye. I hope I\u2019m deep, but I\u2019m not very complicated. My most appealing qualities are intelligence (hopefully mixed with some wisdom now) and humor (tending toward the wry and the silly)..\nI\u2019ve been a social hermit for a long time. But thanks to sustained lifestyle, diet, and exercise changes over the years, I\u2019m now in the best physical condition and health of my life.\nThat in turn has changed my attitudes and activities dramatically, and for the better. I do cardio and resistance training at home; I\u2019ve embraced a new sport (road cycling); and I\u2019m eager to return to some other sports that I\u2019ve done well in the past, and to try new ones. My next romantic partner will also be a workout partner.\nI\u2019m fond of romantic, exotic places. But I also appreciate the breadth and quality of entertainment opportunities. A romantic partner would enhance all of my typical entertainments \u2014 dining out; catching a movie, or a live performance or even just curling up at home together for \u2018Game of Thrones.\u2019 But I\u2019m confident that I will also enjoy and embrace some of your favorite activities once you\u2019ve introduced me to them. And we\u2019ll surely find new thrills together that will become \u2018ours.\u2019\nIf you\u2019re right for me, then you are very bright, fit, attractive, curious, romantic, passionate, independent, and reasonably well-balanced (neurotic\u2019s okay, psychotic isn\u2019t). You\u2019re as comfortable in jeans as your little black dress, and we\u2019ll look good together anywhere.", "email": " cupples_j@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["cupplesj1.jpg", "cupplesj2.jpg", "cupplesj3.jpg", "cupplesj4.jpg", "cupplesj5.jpg"]}
