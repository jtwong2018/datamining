First of all . . I HATE talking about myself! But if I must . . . I would describe myself as a little shy when first meeting new people, but once I get to know you . . . look out! I am a very outgoing, friendly person who is passionate and fiercely loyal when it comes to my family and friends. I enjoy my work, but prefer time spent with loved ones. I have many interests and enjoy just about any activities as long as they are done with friends (yes, even watching the Superbowl, even football in general . . . as long as it\u2019s a Saints game!). I am active in the community and spend a lot of time participating in various civic and school activities and fundraising events. JUSTINIRBY147 AT YEAH WHOO DOT COME\nI guess I am looking for someone who is a \u201cpeople person\u201d like me, but who also enjoys alone time with just the two of us. Someone who is loyal, loving, funny, fun to be around, faithful, NOT jealous . . . I think we all have little twinges of jealousy from time to time . . . that\u2019s human nature . . . but my partner must be able to trust me. If there is no trust in the relationship, there is no relationship, and that goes two ways. Preferably, he would be as comfortable at a \u201cblack tie\u201d event as he is barbecuing on the deck in the back yard. But most of all, he must love to hold hands, be affectionate, give and receive massages, enjoy spending time with my family and friends as well as his, and be as supportive of me as I am of hER", "email": " justinirby147@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "datelink"], "gender": "male", "images": ["justinirby1.jpg"]}
