My sense of humor is a little different. If you like to laugh\u2026we\u2019re going to get along just fine. I love the beach, swimming in the ocean, the moon and stars, meals out, meals in, good music, movies, dogs, golfing, fishing, and adore the company of an intelligent, funny, fun, witty, and engaging woman. Bottom line\u2026I\u2019m looking for something unique, with someone unique.\nI believe in three things very strongly. #1. Life is short. Be yourself and be happy. #2. Laugh as often as possible. It\u2019s good for the heart, mind, and soul. #3. If you say something\u2026do it. If you don\u2019t mean it\u2026don\u2019t say it.\u00a0Things that are important to me: honesty, trust, respect, communication, and kissing! I think kissing reveals someone\u2019s true passion and soul.", "email": " meek_92@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "lavaplace", "okcupid", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["berk1.jpg", "berk2.jpg"]}
