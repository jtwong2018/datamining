I am healthy individual with healthy habits and I do my best to continue to keep that healthy life style. I think of myself as a caring, kind, spiritually inclined &amp; diverse individual due to my cultural background and upbringing. I do intend to be considerate to other people\u2019s feelings and their needs. I am culturally adaptable, easy going and like to laugh and have fun. I like education, knowledge and information to help myself as well as others for improving our lives for better quality of living. My spirituality and believing in higher power (God) does remove me from our earthly and selfish desires which consequently protect me to minimize my urge to submit myself to superficiality, shallow way of thinking, weaknesses and corruption in my daily life.", "email": " dr.anderson770@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["dan0091.jpg"]}
