People who don\u2019t have it think beauty is a blessing but actually it sets you apart.truth,goodness and beauty are but different faces.do you love me because I\u2019m beautiful or am I beautiful because you love me? Give me reasons to love again .nothing hurts more than realizing he meant everything to you but you meant nothing to him.I have been lied to,cheated on,hurts one too many times,really the heart was made yo be broken,once the one you loves let you down it feels as though your heart was ripped out and trust becomes something that is earned.there was a time I trusted blindly but now I see the truth,to protect my heart from any hurt,I can\u2019t freely place my trust in you,I would love to share with someone special.I\u2019m looking for man that can love me as much as I can love him and be a role midel in my life.I\u2019m looking for my other half, a friend as well as a lover. I know every woman wants to find a man who calls her beautiful instead of hot,who calls her back when she hangs upon him,who will lie under the stars and listen her heartbeat or Will stay awake just to watch you sleep( no stalkers please) Lol\u2026. Seriously a man who can take his woman to the next level .lots of people want to ride with you when you are in the limo but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down..I am a down to earth individual with no heart to play games or drama.we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love\u2026.they say true love hides behind every corner,I must be walking in circles,I do not have IM I can only be reached by text on my phone ..am just here looking for the one\u2026\u2026..Michelle boswell", "email": " Boswellm15@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Michelle1.jpg", "Michelle2.jpg", "Michelle3.jpg"]}
