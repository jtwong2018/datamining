I believe in being open and honest, loving your family, being a REAL friend, treating others with respect, being committed to the ones you love regardless of their actions, showing affection, doing the little things that show you care, listening before deciding, and of course true love. I love children and spending time teaching and mentoring them. In a \u201csocial\u201d setting, I am somewhat quite and a little shy in the beginning,but I open up more and more as trust and bonds are formed. I love playing golf,and all outdoor activities, almost any sport, hiking,biking,etc.But I also like staying at home watching movies and cooking dinner. Am new to this online thing and am looking for an attractive and honest man to spend time with and get to know, friends at first, maybe more later. Looks are definitely not everything, but some physical attraction has to exist for a relationship to begin. But, just as important I do believe people become more attractive or lessattractive as you get to know them\u2026 PERSONALITY is important too!! I want to have that special something deep inside that can\u2019t be described in words. You can only know what it is by experiencing it.That mutual connection between two people that is just there naturally. Im self employed and enjoying it\u2026im a marketer and very intresting", "email": " ninawale05@outlook.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "matchdoctor"], "gender": "female", "images": ["prettienina1.jpg", "prettienina2.jpg", "prettienina3.jpg", "prettienina4.jpg", "prettienina5.jpg"]}
