A positive person who looks at the half fullness rather than the half emptiness of things. Someone who also has a healthy understanding of who they are and how they fit into the world around them and has given some thought to the life imprint they want to leave on the world around them and moreover the people around them.", "email": " ted.raymond@mail.ru", "tags": ["Male profiles", "military scammer", "Sven"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Ted441.jpg"]}
