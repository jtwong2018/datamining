I feel age is just a number and you should always try to keep your appearance young looking and staying active. I enjoy long walks, dining out with the right person and listening to good music. Dancing, singing, playing the piano, viewing beautiful artwork and working with my hands are just a few of my interest. I love spending time outside, especially during the fall. I have been told I am a ball of fire and full of energy. I love getting dressed up and going out but enjoy those special nights listening to music snuggled in a blanket curled up on the sofa. I would like to meet a loyal companion with a few similar interests and that we could enjoy doing things together. He would feel comfortable around my family and friends, enjoy the outdoors, holding hands, have a strong love and loyalty to family, faith and friends. I am looking for someone who is outgoing, honest, warm, compassionate, and open with their feelings. There is so much more I would like to share but I would rather save it for that one special guy who really wants to get to know me. I have only experience a couple dates on these sites and unfortunately got hurt. So I am giving it one more shot before I throw my computer in the trash. Thank-you for reading my profile and I look forward to meeting you someday.", "email": " pdarkoaa2@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["benoni1.jpg"]}
