I\u2019m easy going, relaxed, honest and have a good sense of humour. I love to have a good laugh, love a good old giggle! I challange myself with what ever life throws at me. I can be stubborn at times, especially when I\u2019m passionate, about something I really care about. Otherwise pretty chilled out and will go with the flow. I love animals of all kind, I have a chocolate Labrador named Ruby n a ginger ninja cat named Leo. I just being outside when the weather is bless and snuggled up inside on those rainy cold days. I enjoy nature, travel, new experiences and making new memories and moments throughout life.\nI enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, good food always brings good times and people together. I also love to go camping, hiking and fishing! so good for the soul! I truly believe things happen for a reason and taking risks is what keeps the soul fired! I prefer honestly and truth then someone fake and just wanting to please people. We are all different for a reason, so embrass yourself and the person you are. Looking to meet someone I can share my life with and enjoy the adventure of life together!", "email": " stella.asnt@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "badoo", "flirthut", "love scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["stellana121.jpg", "stellana122.jpg"]}
