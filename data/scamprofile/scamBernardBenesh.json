I love all types of arts &amp; crafts projects. I prefer cooler temperatures over hot. Honesty, trust, care and love means a lot to me and I hate liars. I am shy but outgoing, timid but strong, a loner but loves to be around people. It all depends on who I am with and how familiar or comfortable I am with them.", "email": " bbenesh@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["BernardBenesh1.jpg", "BernardBenesh2.jpg"]}
