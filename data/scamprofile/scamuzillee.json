Someone to hold, to smile with, to love and cherish. Looking for that girl I can\u2019t wait to see, to hear, to hold again. The one who makes the world fall away and there is only you and I. I enjoy nature and its beautiful scenery. I\u2019m passionate and caring. I like to get dressed up, whether it be jeans and a collard shirt or a suit and tie just give me an excuse. I like to stay in the background and run things from behind but will step forward and take charge if need be. I\u2019m a quiet guy with a loud voice. Am a guy with big personality and a subtle guy that doesn\u2019t mind being not so subtle when appropriate. I feel I\u2019m an interesting and outgoing guy that likes to go out and have a good time but also enjoys time at home relaxing. I love to go and explore new places and visit old favorites.i love traveling and all kinds of adventous I am very family oriented and am loyal, truth", "email": " richieluck3@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "tagged", "thairomances"], "gender": "male", "images": ["uzillee1.jpg", "uzillee2.jpg", "uzillee3.jpg", "uzillee4.jpg"]}
