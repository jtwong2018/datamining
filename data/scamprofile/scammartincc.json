My communicative character helps me to have many friends but at the end they all turn out to be fake! I had only one good friend who passed away some few years back in Sweden. I am Swedish but been living here in the state since i was 19 Years. I hate lie and betrayal, so I would never be with the person who lies and I personally never cheat on my close people. People who know me say they can easy talk on any topic with me and I am glad they feel that everything I say or do goes from my heart. I am passionate and affectionate \u2013 I am sure my future wife will value these features in me.", "email": " tinaw3037@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["martincc1.jpg"]}
