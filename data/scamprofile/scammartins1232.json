Outstanding sense of humor. I make everyone feel comfortable and also seem to have the nack for making people laugh and feel good about themselves. I believe there is something good in everyone.

If you think you might have an interest just let me know and we can exchange a few emails and then meet. I\u2019m really here to find someone meaningful. I have a goal and hopefully you do too.
