I have a quirky sense of humor and a constant thirst for knowledge. Respect is very important to me, both giving and receiving. I try to live by a code of fairness, respect and honesty. I try to treat people the way I want to be treated. I can be very loving and giving, but never suffocating or needy. I don\u2019t sweat the small stuff, keep going even when life gets nasty, and face each day with a smile and positive attitude. You never know, and I always want to be ready for it,I believe in fairness, honesty, respect and doing the right thing, even if it\u2019s difficult. I don\u2019t want drama. If there\u2019s a problem, I like to deal with it right away and not let things linger. I speak my mind, and you will never have to guess what I\u2019m thinking or feeling.", "email": " johnthomas4444@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["johnthomas1.jpg"]}
