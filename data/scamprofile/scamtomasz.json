I am a romantic and appreciate the simple things in life, such as hike in the redwoods, the mountains, or overlooking the ocean. Activities I enjoy and would like to share are walks and hikes, the arts, dancing, movies, reading, travel, and all types of music\u2013from blues to jazz to classical \u2014 and yes, opera.I enjoy dining and wine tasting as well as cooking and entertaining. I value a woman who likes to dialogue, is intuitive, bright, open, warm, caring, straightforward, and has her own way of being creative. Someone who would offer me her hand to begin our journey, side by side. Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.", "email": " tomaszmanri@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["tomasz1.jpg"]}
