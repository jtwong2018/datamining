I think I\u2019m pretty easy to get along with. I think it\u2019s because I like to listen just as much as I like to talk. People find it easy to communicate with me and I think that\u2019s a big reason why. I would like to find someone who enjoys some of the same things I do, as well as having some other interest that could be introduced into the mix\u2026. My biggest requirment is that someone be honest\u2026. I am looking for someone that can make me laugh, personality is so important! I am a very caring a loyal woman and look for the same in a man.", "email": " worthspotr75@openmailbox.org", "tags": ["Female profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sweetyflo761.jpg", "sweetyflo762.jpg"]}
