Here are some adjectives that describe me: honest, friendly, articulate, dependable, fit, active, bright, secure (emotionally and financially) and adventurous. I\u2019m mature and responsible but youthful and fun to be around. For fitness I run and rock climb. I love to travel and often take trips to climb, ski, hike, backpack or sail\u2026or sometimes just to see what\u2019s there. I have season tickets for UVA football and basketball and also enjoy sampling the entertainment offerings around town \u2013 from comedy to symphony. Just hanging out with a beer or a glass of wine can be nice too. I\u2019m a bit of a news junkie and I even watch a few dramas and &quot;reality&quot; shows on TV (thank goodness for TiVo). I don\u2019t lack in emotional or intellectual depth but I\u2019m definitely not complicated. I\u2019m actively involved in the life of my family,friends and kids. I\u2019d love to share more and find out about you over coffee or a drink. I hope to make a connection with a best friend and lover\nI desire to meet a woman who knows how to treat her man perfectly when it comes to loving,caring and show her compassion, Its true that finding true love means one has become complete in life.
