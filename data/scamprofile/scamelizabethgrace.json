I don\u2019t judge people and I don\u2019t mind people being themselves as long as they aren\u2019t fake. I can be both conservative and liberal and would rather not define myself. I am what you think I am but not a stereotype of anyone\u2019s mind. I like humour and I don\u2019t mind it brings silly or dark. I love to write; do Yoga and hang out with friends.", "email": " elizabeth100grace@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "female", "images": ["elizabethgrace1.jpg", "elizabethgrace2.jpg", "elizabethgrace3.jpg", "elizabethgrace4.jpg"]}
