Always thought that was silly\u2026 Well ,I guess the joke is on me\u2026I have friends who have cancer and that made me think that we are not here forever,not even close, so all I want for the rest of my life no matter how short or long that life might be is somebody to share it with. A laughter, a tear, good moments or not so great moments, a kiss under a moonlight, or a kiss under a sunlight. Or just a really quiet nite., when we dont have to say a word. Just look at each other eyes and let our hearts do the talking for us\u2026\u2026 Is that too mushy?", "email": " mcole6074@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "christiandatingforfree", "hangouts", "romance scammer", "waydate"], "gender": "female", "images": ["childtrip111.jpg"]}
