I believe in being open and honest, loving your family, being a REAL friend, treating others with respect, being committed to the ones you love regardless of their actions, showing affection, doing the little things that show you care, listening before deciding, and of course true love. I love children and spending time teaching and mentoring them. In a \u201csocial\u201d setting, I am somewhat quite and a little shy in the beginning, but I open up more and more as trust and bonds are formed. I love playing golf, and all outdoor activities, almost any sport, hiking, biking, etc.But I also like staying at home watching movies and cooking dinner.", "email": " wilfredbrooks9@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sweetlorena1.jpg"]}
