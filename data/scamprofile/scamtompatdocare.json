I am a very caring and sensitive person, I am a level headed, down to earth person who is totally devoted to the one I love. I tend to be shy at first, but I will open up quickly with the right person.I am confident, calm, and happy. An introvert by nature, I am quiet, structured, and organized. i think i\u2019m a pretty easy going person. I love to be shown affection and don\u2019t have any problem whatsoever showing the right person lots of of it, i always say if its better to give than to recieve. I think that i have a pretty strange sense of humor at times. i look at it this way i\u2019d rather make a joke than to sit around and dwell on things i can\u2019t do much of anything about.I literally despise people who put on or lie about things and think they can get away with it where i\u2019m concerned.I consider myself a sensitive, kind, and gentle person who enjoys being with people. I like going to the movies, listening to music, taking long walks on the beach.Favorite activities are going to the movies,taking walks the beach, being healthy. Most of all I love to be romantic for that special someone.", "email": " tompatdocare@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["tompatdocare1.jpg"]}
