I am an officer of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. I am a nice man, honest and caring man with a good sense of humor. I love meeting new people and their lifestyle. I like the new parts of the world, the tranquility of the sea, beautiful mountains and life has to offer. I love movies, reading books, listening to music, see the tears of God in the rain, dance, cooking .. but I can be as comfortable as at home \u2026 rolled with a good book by the fire with you by my side. I\u2019m looking for a real and significant intimate relationship where there is love, passion and romance.", "email": " bucktudu@msn.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "military scammer", "Stuart James"], "gender": "male", "images": ["tuduh1.jpg", "tuduh2.jpg", "tuduh3.jpg"]}
