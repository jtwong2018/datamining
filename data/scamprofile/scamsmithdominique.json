If at my age i do not know what and when to say the words, then what would i be? When a wise man sees he has probably spent about half of his time in life already, he begins to assess his main goals in life. What could be more important than a happy ending? LOL,. A man needs to live his life full of joy and happiness. No matter his achievements, he is reduced to nothing if he has no crown to complete hIm and that is a man to call his own. Wife and Best friend. A man who knows that even while arguing they still need to hold hands. A woman whom i can call a partner in crime,lol A man whom you can tell anything. How could you think anything can make you happier in life than finding a love that knows no bound.\nI am far from a millionaire and am not out for anything but love from someone.
