I have strong principles and they help me to make decisions in life. I am very curious and always try to develop myself. I like changes and bright emotions. I like to try new things in my life. I am not afraid to be wrong and make some mistake. It is normal for people who are trying to achieve their goals. I never give up and try to be optimistic in every situation. I can be a strong woman, but I need a real man, with whom I will feel fragile with. I\u2019m looking for a real relationship and not virtual communication. But I understand that first we need to know each other. After all, we are here to meet in the future, is that not it?", "email": " becy.adams@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "dateolicious", "ilikeyou"], "gender": "female", "images": ["gladysdiva1.jpg"]}
