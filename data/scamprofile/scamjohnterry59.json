I am sure that you have already found this about two hundred times in all the other profiles. I believe that words are cheap, but actions speak louder than voice, so why bother? why not start with a bad stuff I am impulsive and restless at times, I cry a times like a baby when I watched stay up way too late often. There is something about the night time that I find magic, which keeps me up working or hanging out aimlessly. Can you relate? I have little patience for flakes and fake people those who smile while being angry on the inside, as I never know what they keep up their sleeve.I\u2019m a very down to earth, honest, polite, considerate, affectionate,and a caring person. On my down time, I like to hang out at extreme sporting events like bmx and bike racing, cruising down along the the coast and enjoying the scenario. I love taking pictures of wherever I go, because pictures capture memories. I like memories, which reminds me places I\u2019ve been Other than just words, I like cars, hiking, dining out, traveling, or cuddle up at home for a good movie.When it comes to relationships, it\u2019s important to always respect the other person.
