I love to laugh and have a pretty serious comedy habit. I like cuddling with my dog, and my niece &amp; nephew. I love to cook. I am pretty good at it too. I enjoy being around people. People are my thing. I like deep conversations about feelings and experiences. I have been told I would make a great life coach and/or therapist. I am very random and have a love for odd things.I have a lot of energy!! I am on here just to dip my toe in the dating pool. Ultimately, I want a long term relationship. Good luck to all you hunters! One of my best friends recently read this and hoped for an endorsement page. He said I was spot on with who I am in my profile. I tend to agree. Lastly, I love making grass Angels, I know it\u2019s inappropriate and doesn\u2019t work, but a white bitch can still have dreams.", "email": " johngary3273@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["johngary1.jpg"]}
