This is my blotch. Put blog and Confirio together and whadaya get?I\u2019ve been blotching for a while now. (You\u2019re like, Hmmmm\u2026) I bet Mr.Confirio envisioned this when he created this site: A virtual village where a boy writes about love, dating, girls and a couple of other things (like breastfeeding and gay-dancing).I haven\u2019t updated my blotch in oodles of days. Blame it on the start of school. Blame it on the rain. Hey, you\u2019ve got to blame it on something. I\u2019ve learned a lot. I\u2019ve learned that girls like to make demands: Make me laugh! Sweep me off my feet! Take my breath away! Teach me how to Dougie, e\u2019erabuddy Dougie! (Btw, the dougie-dude hates skinny jeans because the burner keep rubbin\u2019.) Or, my favorite Confirio-girl demand: Make me forget my ex, because we just separated yesterday! I\u2019m kidding about some of those. I\u2019m not kidding about the first three. What am I looking for in a relationship? WOW!!! That\u2019s a loaded question. First of all, this person would have to be honest, loyal, trustworthy, and attractive inside and out. I\u2019m seeking that special person that recognizes when someone is doing something special for them and has the awareness to at a minimum say \u201cThank you\u201d, someone who\u2019s a Team player, someone I can talk to about anything and don\u2019t have to worry about being judged. I am not perfect by any means and I don\u2019t expect this person to be either. There was only one \u201cPerfect Man\u201d the rest of us are just \u201cWork in Progress\u201d. I\u2019m looking for a relationship with a \u201clady\u201d, someone that makes both of us stronger as individuals and partners. Scared yet? I love Country music and some songs give a person a great way to express themselves. Check out Randy Howsers latest release titled \u201cIn God\u2019s Time\u201d and you\u2019ll see what I mean. There are many, many more out there that I\u2019d like to share with that special someone.", "email": " declanfunman1@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["awesomelove19671.jpg", "awesomelove19672.jpg", "awesomelove19673.jpg", "awesomelove19674.jpg"]}
