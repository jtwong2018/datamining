I practice both and expect both. I am still a fairly ambitious professional as I enjoy my lifestyle, and it did not get there on love alone. That said, I compartmentalize my work and make room for personal relationships. What do I want from a relationship and what do I have to offer a relationship? If you take the time to get to know me, you will figure out the answers to those questions for yourself. Meanwhile, I will be learning things about you and coming up with my own answers. After learning the hard way, I want to take the relationship process more deliberately as it lowers the potential for mistakes and hurt emotions \u2013 which I don\u2019t want for either of us. Let\u2019s determine if we can be friends first. Then, take some time to get to know each other well. If we decide to go beyond that, we\u2019ll both be more comfortable.", "email": " ben_ank@outlook.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["hvp20151.jpg"]}
