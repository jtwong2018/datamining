I enjoy meaningful conversation in addition to plain old good fun. I\u2019m basically a very positive person who also loves humor and laughter and would like someone with an adventurous spirit and a positive attitude who can see the funny side of life,someone who is open and willing to learn new things. I like to share things I learn and am open to learning new things as well. I have a passion for music and a curiosity for life. To find a woman who loves to dance would be a miracle, but not impossible I believe, even if rare, but definitely a bonus, but not a requirement! lol I also love a man who knows how to treat a woman like a baby and a baby like a woman.", "email": " Darren_richard60@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "datemefree", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Darren10101.jpg", "Darren10102.jpg", "Darren10103.jpg"]}
