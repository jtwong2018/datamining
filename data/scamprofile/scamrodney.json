You keep them by the qualities you possess..The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain never let your past Run over your Life\u2026When we Get Hurt we Need to Keep On With Life\u2026No matter how ugly or beautiful you think you are,that special man that loves you believes you are the most beautiful and irresistible thing on earth and nothing can ever change that\u2026Love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It\u2019s not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end never give up about life and also be positive about things.What I\u2019m looking for is someone who is quick-witted, independent, liberal-minded, creative, kind, honest, nurturing, warm and affectionate. I thrive on a woman\u2019s touch, so I hope that comes naturally to you. Other things are negotiable. If you feel we might be a good match, I\u2019d love to hear from you. And if not, well, I guess hate mail is better than no mail.
