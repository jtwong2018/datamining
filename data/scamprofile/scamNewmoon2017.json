Relish the times with friends and family. I have a compassionate heart for \u201cmost\u201d people. Probably a little too trusting and gullible at first. I love to challenge myself with knew knowledge and yet go deeper with God everyday in time for prayer and meditation. I love to sing , it makes me feel carefree and childlike, a great way to express myself. I love and care deeply and have found in being that way that forgiveness is the key to truely loving others and mostly forgiving myself.", "email": " louisaquainoo2020@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Newmoon20171.jpg"]}
