I am not perfect, but I have a lot of good qualities such as sincerity, understanding and patience. I really love nature, long walks and just being in the forest or near the water. I enjoy going out and spending my spare time in a company of good friends. I also like cooking something special; I enjoy fine candle-light dinners. I like traveling and adventures. But my main passion is music\u2026 I know how music influence and changes the mood, that is why I prefer to start my day by turning on my radio or CD player and dancing while getting ready to go to work. I am sincere in my feelings, deeds and attitude to people. I cannot lie. I like and can listen to other people. I have a gentle character and cannot quarrel and call names. I am tolerant to other people weak points. All of us are different.", "email": " brian_williamtreece@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "George Osborne", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["brianw1.jpg", "brianw2.jpg", "brianw3.jpg"]}
