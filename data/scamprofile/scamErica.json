I don\u2019t sleep around so I am disease free. I\u2019m a pretty easy going person n go with the flow of things. I am the only child of my parent. My family n friends are my life. I love to read, draw, photography, pretty much anything to do with art, I love going on nature walks. If there is anything else that u would like to know about me just message me. I am tired of guys saying things that they don\u2019t mean. If u don\u2019t mean it than dont say it. If ur looking for a one night stand or a piece of a** sorry but I\u2019m not that girl. I\u2019m the girl that wants more (a meaningful relationship). I don\u2019t care about the materialistic things. What matters to me is that u treat me good n r open n talk to me. Don\u2019t be a coward to say what\u2019s on ur mind or how u feel. If u can\u2019t do that than why the hell r u looking for a girlfriend.", "email": " anassgh22@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "datehookup", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Erica1.jpg"]}
