There has to be mutual respect between partners. A successful relationship should be built on trust, understanding &amp; friendship. Physical attraction is only the surface. You should be attracted to each others minds &amp; spirits. There has to be a high level of consideration for each others feelings, wants, likes &amp; dislikes. Understanding should be there that each person is different in his or her own way.", "email": " km1258782@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["km12587821.jpg"]}
