I am a rather romantic person. I like communicating and enjoy spending my time with my friends. I hate when people lie and cheat on each other. I am not selfish and I always care about my friends and relatives. I am quite mature in spite of my age. I live alone, separately from my parents. My heart is not empty. It is full of emotions and feelings. It is difficult for me to refuse when somebody asks me for help. I have many activities in my life. I like to dance and to go to fitness. I like being outdoors. Also I enjoy walking by the seaside. Cooking is also one of my favorite hobbies.
