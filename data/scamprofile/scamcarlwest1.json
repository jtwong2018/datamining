As i say I\u2019m not asking for a dozen roses or a diamond give me a weed that\u2019s given from your heart i will love it just the same.\nI have self respect, morals and standards. Self worth I love who I am. I can do just about anything as well as any one else if you set your mind to it. Love to learn new things meet new people go to new places\nI truly believe friendship makes a first impression and if it ends up in a relationship well that\u2019s a bonus and a lasting relationship. I feel people must always communicate or there is a break down and misunderstandings happen. I am by no means perfect I have my flaws if i didn\u2019t i wouldn\u2019t be human. I get scared if things move to fast. Been hurt and i learned from that.\nAny ways I am the type of person that likes to help others but not get so wrapped up it takes away from my time or relationship time. I learn balance and effectiveness. I have a great smile and talking eyes!", "email": " carlwest1@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "David Gandy", "flirthut", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["carlwest11.jpg"]}
