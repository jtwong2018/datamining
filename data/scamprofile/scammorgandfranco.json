So here goes. I\u2019m a professional and responsible guy looking to meet a responsible woman. I love the beach. I enjoy dining out, dancing, the movies and taking strolls on the beach, preferably with an attractive female companion. I\u2019m recently divorced and not unhappy about being single. . I enjoy the going out, especially places with live music, but I\u2019m also giving this internet thing a shot. I would really like to meet someone new to share my life and have fun. I believe that once you\u2019ve met me, at the very least ..you would like me. So why not give us a chance to find out if there is any chemistry here. You can\u2019t light a fire without a spark !!!", "email": " morgandfranco@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "dateolicious"], "gender": "male", "images": ["morgandfranco1.jpg"]}
