I am very easy going and laid back. I am often told that I am very easy to talk with. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is. Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way i view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows. I would do the best with someone that isn\u2019t extremely uptight, unless of course you are willing to learn to let things go! I do not like controlling women who do not communicate well and have agendas or excessive previous baggage. I like women who I can have a good conversation with and we can communicate in a mutually beneficial way. \u2026. I like women who are interested in exercise and physical fitness. I like women who read to improve themselves and find value in self help books. I also like women who are either spiritual but not necessary religious. I also enjoy attending a good church that leaves you feeling better about yourself when you leave.", "email": " frankiess8928@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "interpals", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["huddleman1.jpg", "huddleman2.jpg", "huddleman3.jpg", "huddleman4.jpg", "huddleman5.jpg", "huddleman6.jpg"]}
