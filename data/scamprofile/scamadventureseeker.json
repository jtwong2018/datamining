During my spare time I like to hang out with friends, listen to music, BBQ, gardening, watch TV and do some outdoor things. I am romantic but at the same time I try to be objective evaluating the world surrounding me. I do like admiring the seascape which make you feel like leaving for a distant journey, learning something new you have never known before. I like having fun, laughing and making people laugh as well. I enjoy going on walks, communicating, cuddling with that special person, spoiling her and treating her like a woman should be treated and having the utmost respect for her. I love candles as I am a very romantic person, holding her while watching a movie. I love the outdoors I am always doing something interesting. I love to go out dancing and just being with my woman. I am not a racist. all people are equal no matter your color or nationality, we are all human.", "email": " patrickclarence79@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "loveandfriends", "tagged"], "gender": "male", "images": ["adventureseeker1.jpg", "adventureseeker2.jpg", "adventureseeker3.jpg"]}
