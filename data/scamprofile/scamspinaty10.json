I love taking off for the day/weekend (anywhere in victoria) going to the city to visit museums, art galleries, I like being out in nature, exploring historic, natural wonders or spending time at country markets, footy, soccer, eating out for dinner (any crusine) with a nice bottle of wine. I love seeing a good movie (drama,action to chick flicks).I enjoy cooking, relaxing in the garden and listening to music (anything in between opera and that head banging crap).
