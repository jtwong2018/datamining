I am a very passionate and very affectionate person,love romance and like a lot of kissing and hugging and cuddling in a relationship,so if you are not that way and don\u2019t love those things too,then we will definitely not be a good match. I have a very youthful appearance.Always told I look younger than my age.I feel young,dress young and act young too..I\u2019m a big football fan, i love manchester united,but i don\u2019t hate the other teams and don\u2019t mind at all if you\u2019re a fan of the enemy-it will makes things more fun when they play each other.I like to watch the games but not at the expense of being with my partner. I love the sun,love the beach and the ocean. I like to go out and love to have fun.I am totally flexible and enjoy doing many things.I am always open to new experiences and love to try new things. Im an energetic outgoing and social person.As long as im with my soul mate it doesn\u2019t matter where we are or what we are doing,it matters that we are together.", "email": " tzmerc@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "metrodate", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["tzmerc1.jpg", "tzmerc2.jpg", "tzmerc3.jpg", "tzmerc4.jpg", "tzmerc5.jpg", "tzmerc6.jpg", "tzmerc7.jpg", "tzmerc8.jpg", "tzmerc9.jpg"]}
