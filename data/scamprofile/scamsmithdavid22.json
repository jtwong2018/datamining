I am very easy going and laid back. I am often told that I am very easy to talk with. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is. Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way I view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows. I have a wonderful Son. I would do best with someone that isn\u2019t extremely uptight, unless of course you are willing to learn to let things go! I love to try new things, and can laugh at myself when I fail miserably. I don\u2019t give up easily, and have so many things I\u2019ve yet to try. Please love to laugh and have fun, what is better than laughing so hard your stomach hurts?! I love traveling, going on unknown adventures, and trying something I thought I never would. I\u2019ll try anything once, well, but fun none the less! I take pride in my appearance, but am not high maintenance. I love a nice dinner out, but staying home, having chines food after a day spent working together on a completely dirty, yet fulfilling project, can be so much fun with the right person. Being honest and open is very important to me and I expect my match to feel the same way. I am not a game player, and I don\u2019t have any interest in dating one. I do however, make exceptions for board game lovers.", "email": " tomcaring22@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer", "someonenew"], "gender": "male", "images": ["smithdavid221.jpg", "smithdavid222.jpg"]}
