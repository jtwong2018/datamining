I am sweet very warm, sensitive and caring, romantic and extremely affectionate. I am a giver. I will go out of my way to help someone and the smile on their face is the best thank you I could ever receive.. I love the outdoors, taking walks,camping, going out to dinner the movies, all the usual things. I love to laugh and make people laugh. I\u00b4m easy going and down to earth. I love to cuddle and snuggle and can be very playfull. I like walking hand in hand or arm in arm. . I like sitting under the stars near a nice campfire or in the back yard on a hammock with a drink.(sorry ladys, I never acquire a taste for beer but I will have a wine) I love romantic walks and talks most of all I love kissing, a meaningful, gentle,tender kiss, the kind of kiss that make your insides go squirrley. I Love to make that unexpected call just to say, \u201cI miss you or am thinking of you\u201d and I know the little unexpected signs of affection keep the relationship alive. I am not materialistic. (So your income is not a factor) I don\u00b4t need to be wined and dined, the little things in life make me happy. plus building a relationship is in the heart not in the pocket.", "email": " martinsdevonshire@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "mydailyflog"], "gender": "male", "images": ["martinslove41.jpg", "martinslove42.jpg", "martinslove43.jpg", "martinslove44.jpg", "martinslove45.jpg"]}
