There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night;I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my profile or take a look at my pictures. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.", "email": " mattewjackson27@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["mathom0151.jpg", "mathom0152.jpg"]}
