I\u2019m a \u201cfly by the seat of his pants\u201d kind of boy, but I can also do organized. I\u2019m affectionate, self motivated, and love having a good time with friends and family. I\u2019m a romantic at heart and truly believe that romance never dies when you are with the right person. I love watching and going to sports events. SEC college football is my favorite, but I also watch the pros. I love weekend trips. Love the beach, mountains\u2026.but it doesn\u2019t really matter where you go, it\u2019s the company you take with you. Traveling\u2026.who doesn\u2019t like to travel? I have been fortunate to have been able to do some traveling, but there are a lot of other places I\u2019d like to see. Italy and Greece are on the top of that list. I take a very self conscious approach to my health trying to stay fit and eat right\u2026..but seriously, I\u2019m not giving up my chocolate! Lol. My smile and my eyes are usually the two things I get the most compliments on. They are, after all, the window to ones soul and tell the most about a person. I\u2019m good hanging out at home at times as well as going out for good times. I don\u2019t have much that keeps me from being unable to pick (or pack) up and go most anytime. I have been single for a long time now and find myself missing having that special someone in my life. I\u2019m looking for a stable, long lasting relationship that is based on love, laughter, honesty, faith, and trust. Someone I can depend on and who can depend on me. Someone that wants to wake up everyday to live life to its fullest. Life is a beautiful journey and I\u2019m ready to get started enjoying it with someone special.\nI\u2019m looking for a stable, long lasting relationship that is based on love, laughter, honesty, faith, and trust.
