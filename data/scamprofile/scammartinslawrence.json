I joined the dating site because I still believe in true love, in romance and the \u201chappily ever after.\u201d but dating from the Internet has been interpreted in so many things that almost can not find the good that comes our way, but with hope and trust we will find what we are all looking for. I\u2019m so tired of my loneliness as I have the love and care soo much in my heart to give my partner if I find her here. I have no rush or hurry to meet my right woman eventually Gods time is the best .. if you wanna get to know me,better ,lets talk more I will stop right here and thanks for the time you had on my profile Enjoy your day \ud83d\ude42", "email": " martinslawrence2016@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["martinslawrence1.jpg"]}
