I am very passionate about enjoying life and having fun. I know life can be \u201cshort\u201d and you need to take life for what it is and do whatever makes you happy!\nI am not perfect and I don\u2019t expect others to be perfect. Primarily what I am looking for is someone who is committed to a long term relationship with a view of marriage.\nI am not the kind who support divorce as a solution to all the complicated problems called life with a capital L. Communication with my partner is very crucial for me. Share,trust and openness will lead to a better relationship with me.\nI am kind of like a chameleon. I can blend into almost any surrounding. I tend to be more reserved. But that only happens when I am around people I don\u2019t know. Once I get to know someone, I open up a lot more.\nYou like what you read because that is exactly what you going to get. Send me a message \u2026 LOL\nI am a fun loving man who enjoys movies, music, dining, and theater. I enjoy a good laugh and having a good time.

I believe Life\u2019s a game to be played with a little adventure and some spontaneity! I have always enjoy the company of someone who appreciates a sense of humor, can be playful and participate in great conversation\u2026Friends describe me as affectionate, sweet, easy-going and thoughtful. I like watching most types of movies, picnics in parks, museums, exploring arts & craft fairs, indoor or outdoor concerts. I\u2019ve sailed before and really like it. I like most music especially jazz & classic, country, gospel\u2026 i always believe that Love is a noble act of self-giving, offering trust, faith, and loyalty. The more you love, the more you lose a part of yourself, yet you don\u2019t become less of who you are; you end up being complete with your loved ones. I don\u2019t want distance to be a barrier between me and my ideal partner because I\u2019m ready to relocate to anywhere convenient for me and my ideal partner if everything should end up well between us..I am willing to get to know more about you. I still believe in the fairy tale,that there is a princess charming out there and a happily ever after.

Two words have been referred by others about my character, \u2018gentleman\u2019 and \u2018caring\u2019.\nI don\u2019t really like to talk about this because it sounds like i\u2019m blowing my own trumpet but anyway once i\u2019m asked i will say my colleague used to tell me I\u2019m a good thinker, great decision maker, good cook and i also make any one around me feel like kings and queens.\nI\u2019m Curious, loving, caring , honest, patience , God fearing and above all trustworthy.", "email": " wribblett351@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "Joseph Dunford", "love scammer", "pof"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Willis885551.jpg", "Willis885552.jpg"]}
