Life has thought me some hard lesson. Take the knowledge and wisdom I\u2019ve gained and combine them with my personal qualities, and you have somebody who will someday be the best thing that ever happened to someone.The one who gains my affection will find me loyal, sincere and honest. Honesty is something I value highly, and when I have met people this way before, things have not gone beyond the first meeting if they turn out to have misrepresented them self in any way. I am here to broaden my opportunities to meet someone, but at the same time I am very content with where my life is now. I am not troubled by my past life.i hope to be in a good relationship would be icing on the cake\u2026.", "email": " maryabdel31@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["PaulSilva1.jpg"]}
