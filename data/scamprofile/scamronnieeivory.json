I can be very very funny and actually I act younger than my years say I am. I love kids and animals very much. Sincere,honest, caring, easygoing, outgoing, fun loving, loyal, affectionate, conservative, sometimes shy but can be outgoing when need be. Hard worker yet I do enjoy down time. I don\u2019t feel my age at all yet. I do like to joke around and I can be humorous at times. I am very well balanced in many areas of my life except one. Which is why I am on this site? I tend to focus on others needs before mine. I love the beach, movies, gardening, cycling, hiking and enjoy golf. I do prefer quite settings and prefer to be in a small circle of people. I enjoy Nature as it\u2019s a reflection of Gods character and creativeness.I was raised in a Christian home.I want to meet that special woman who would bring joy into my life.", "email": " ronnieeivory@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "hangouts", "metrodate", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["ronnieeivory1.jpg", "ronnieeivory2.jpg", "ronnieeivory3.jpg", "ronnieeivory4.jpg"]}
