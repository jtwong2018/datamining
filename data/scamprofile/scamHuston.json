When you get to know me you will have made a good friend and catch. A brief history of my life. For awhile I took several acting courses and studied on-camera techniques just for fun. I also took cooking and pastry classes. I have volunteered at many Hi-Profile events just for fun. On a serious note I took business management courses so that I could prove to be an asset to my families business. I am very handy at fixing things and consider myself to be a well rounded person. My life and ambitions, I am California born and Bred having grown-up in the San Fernando Valley. I have a younger sister she is married with 2 children. I attended California State University Los Angeles and studied Rehabilitative Counseling. I did my internship at the American Red Cross. I decided to work in the family business which is Real Estate. My ideal relationship is when you know that the other person is the right person in your mind and heart. I would like to share my life with someone who feels respect and love for me, and I, in turn would offer the same for her. I am looking for a relationship with a lady that wants to be serious. I do not play games and seeking a person who wants a committed relationship. I am a kind honest guy with a lot of love to share.
