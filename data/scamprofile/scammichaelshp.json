I can stay home on weekends, but enjoy being out and about. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I enjoy watching movies at home especially when it\u2019s cold and dreary out. I tell my friends I\u2019m shy, but they don\u2019t believe me. Once you get to know me, I can be quite witty. I have two kids, one that lives with me full time and the other part time (he is adopted and has Down Syndrome). Both boys are truly the light of my heart. I can describe myself in two ways \u2013 simple and down to earth. I\u2019m very humble, not shy and like to be upfront. I want to find someone that is interested in the things that I like to do.
