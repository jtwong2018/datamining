I\u2019m a very humble man. I understand that there\u2019s a time to give and be loving and understanding. I also believe in standing up for what I believe and not being walked on. I\u2019m always there for my friends and loved ones. I don\u2019t run from adversity. I care what people think of me because I believe in being the best man I can be. I want people who come across me to think \u201chey what a cool guy\u201d. It\u2019s not about attention for me. It\u2019s about the importance of ones own honor and respect for those around him.", "email": " franklincarter1957@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "military scammer", "Sven"], "gender": "male", "images": ["franklincarter1.jpg"]}
