I\u2019ve Learned that money and opportunities come and go, but your friends and family are always there to help you when you need it. There\u2019s nothing like a good dinner and then going for a walk with a great companion at sunset! But it\u2019s give and take too, and I will not complain when you take me along shopping or at the salon while I sit in the waiting room as you get your nails done. I understand that being together Is the most important part of a relationship no matter what we are doing (besides communication, of course) .I fully do not expect you to message me, I guess if I was getting 20 or 30 messages a day from people I would not have to. Unfortunately real, honest guys like me get passed over often Because we do not stand out among the dog reds on here to find a date. But if you\u2019re trying one of the few facts and reading this to meet someone you like actually, dont hesitate to get in touch. lets go on to adventure.are you ready?.Text me at eight one three four four four eight seven seven one", "email": " hamenayg@gmx.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "military scammer", "pof", "Raymond Chandler"], "gender": "male", "images": ["hrtinme1.jpg"]}
