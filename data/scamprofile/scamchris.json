I do believe you are out there.\nA lady I can talk with, laugh with (I know I will make you laugh, hail\u2026if you want to laugh at me\u2026GREAT!), hold hands with, embrace in good and sad times.\nOne that will make my heart melt when she winks at me from across a crowded room.\nWe will go out for walks, see movies, have dinner, enjoy each other\u2019s company to the fullest.\nStaying in on a cold evening, cooking a dinner (together), watching a movie on tv, (in front of the fireplace) while cuddling is just fine by me too. Share the experiences of travel (may it just be a weekend road trip or a tropical getaway)\nI do like to go out and enjoy the night on the town\u2026we all like that\u2026yes?\nListening to live music is one of my favourite things to do, well..ok..riding my motorcycle rates right up there! Going to hockey games, playing my guitars, cars, arena/outdoor concerts, camping, skiing, visiting with family and friends are just a few others to mention.\nI do have 1 adult Daughter that has come into her own very well! I love her very much and am really proud of her!!\nI am very well grounded with my job and have been for many years. Having a good sense of humor (so I\u2019ve been told) does help in the workplace as well as my personal life.\nWhen you have my heart\u2026its only YOU!\nAre YOU out there?\nQuestions or simply want to talk, please do", "email": " chrisfemi7@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["chris1.jpg"]}
