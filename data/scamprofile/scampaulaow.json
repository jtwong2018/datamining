Can be your friend,lover,partner or all of them rolled into one.That part is up to you.Am ready for any new adventures that life throws at me.Just need someone to travel the journey with me. My time is spent with work (not my life though) and spending time with friends I don\u2019t cheat or lie\u2026hate people who lie. Trust is a big thing, your relationship is over if the trust has gone. I would rather be happy enjoying your company at home watching a movie, weekends away going for a walk it does not matter as long as you can be happy too, my partner is someone I care for in everyway", "email": " paulaowen49@outlook.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["paulaow1.jpg", "paulaow2.jpg", "paulaow3.jpg"]}
