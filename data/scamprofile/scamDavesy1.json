After giving me all her heart till she passed away i think i am now ready for the next phase life has to bring my way. I joined here to meet someone special who would find and share same or similar interest in romance, love and a loving relationship. I want a life time companion or better still a one last shot at love. I believe for every relationship to work the chemistry, commitment and communication has to be healthy for the depth of the relationship to be respectable and what everyone would envy and cherish to have in their respective relationships as well. Could she be out there could i just be day dreaming i am quite optimistic in nature i would like to believe she is out there somewhere and i would take a bow to meet her pretty soon.", "email": " lukegold@protonmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "mingle2", "pof"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Davesy11.jpg", "Davesy12.jpg", "Davesy13.jpg", "Davesy14.jpg", "Davesy15.jpg", "Davesy16.jpg"]}
