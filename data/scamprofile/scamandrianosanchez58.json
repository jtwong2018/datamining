I am passionate and affectionate man giving hugs and kisses to my lady.I am self confident,independent,I do what is good at the right time. I like going out and hanging with good friends,reading motivational books such as bible and novel. I like swimming,cooking and watching movies\nI am sweet, thoughtful, kind, and have a great sense of humor. I am very easy going and laid back. I am often told that I am very easy to talk with. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is. Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way I view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows\u2026I would do best with someone that isn\u2019t extremely uptight, unless of course you are to learn to let things go! I love to try new things, and can laugh at myself when I fail miserably. I don\u2019t give up easily, and have so many things I\u2019ve yet to try. Please love to laugh and have fun, what is better than laughing so hard your stomach hurts?! I love traveling, going on unknown adventures, and trying something I thought I never would. I\u2019ll try anything once, well, but fun none the less! I take pride in my appearance, but am not high maintenance. I love a nice dinner out, but staying home, having chines food after a day spent working together on a completely dirty, yet fulfilling project, can be so much fun with the right person\u2026. Being honest and open is very important to me and I expect my match to feel the same way. I am not a game player, and I don\u2019t have any interest in dating one. I do however, make exceptions for board game lovers. I am very creative and artistic. I love working on my house and digging in my gardens, I have no problem getting dirt under my nails. I believe in a best friend to spend my life with, and if it takes awhile and I meet new friends along the way, that\u2019s a good thing too. Please have an adventurous silly side, although I can be very sophisticated when necessary, life isn\u2019t as much fun if you subdue your inner child all the time.Am very romantic person, passionate and emotional, kindhearted and have the fear of God", "email": " andrianosanchez58@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "badoo", "confirio", "matchdoctor", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["andrianosanchez581.jpg", "andrianosanchez582.jpg"]}
