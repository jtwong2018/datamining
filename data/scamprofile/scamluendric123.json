One I don\u2019t play game please don\u2019t with me, I am what I am, I expect the same. I\u2019m a strong professional businessman and in life. I work hard but at the same time I enjoy life so when I play I like to play hard. I\u2019m working on a part of me that I seem to have a hard time with patience\u2019s, not one of my virtues in life. I do know this I think I\u2019m finally starting get it.\nI am looking for someone that enjoys the simple things in life, just as I do. I would like to meet someone special that I can grow old with, and that we can always look into each other\u2019s eyes and know that the love between us is just as wonderful and exciting as the day we met.", "email": " cucolotony121266@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "Anthony Cucolo", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["luendric1231.jpg", "luendric1232.jpg", "luendric1233.jpg", "luendric1234.jpg", "luendric1235.jpg"]}
