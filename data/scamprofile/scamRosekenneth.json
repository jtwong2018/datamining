I am a Single female and seeking a man that would love me and we both create a happy and great family together To me, romance means a woman that has what is called the old fashion values(lol). Opening doors for men, sending flowers for no apparent reason but to say that she was thinking of you or sending flowers on holidays that flowers are just about tradition (i.e Valentines day, Anniversaries). A woman that shares her feelings (saying I Love You), you get the idea. I am a big believer in telling it like it is, except if it would hurt someone. I am interested in someone who has the time to devote to a relationship or who will at least try to make the time, as I would. Honesty is my ONLY policy. Nothing is worse than finding out that a relationship is based on lies because i have been hurt so much by that. I am very interested in taking good care of myself and would like to find someone who believes in the same thing. I exercise several times a week and would love to have a workout partner.Employment is an absolute. I love getting dressed up, and in general looking good for my Man .
