I like traveling, because I love the surprise of the unknown. I love to learn about new places, people and cultures. There are many things I like to do \u2013 reading & playing sports, walking around with friends & watching good movies. Depending on which kind of people I meet, I can be very talkative or really reserved \u2013 it depends how comfortable I feel where I am. I especially value humor, being able to laugh at yourself, being able to communicate, culture in general, social issues, staying healthy, and the freedom to think out of the box. I\u2019m looking for a partner \u2013 someone with a strong personality, yet also able to make the compromises that life sometimes requires.", "email": " dawnrooney247@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "mingle2"], "gender": "female", "images": ["dawnluvheart2471.jpg", "dawnluvheart2472.jpg", "dawnluvheart2473.jpg"]}
