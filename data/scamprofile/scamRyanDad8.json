I enjoy hiking, bike riding, fishing and other outdoor stuff. I like coffee early in the morning, smell of Bacon, sleeping with the tv on, overnight movie marathon, the smell of the airport during vacation, road trips, new gadget electronics and old furniture, new socks and hot showers, fast cars and driving slow. I believe in endless chivalry, manners, and mutual respect\u2026 and I hate stupid rules, stupid answers, and rude people. Just msg me if u want to know more.\nI would love to meet someone that would enjoy eating my cooking/cooking with me, or going out to fun places, exploring flea markets and other out of the way places, floating/camping and not be worried about getting a little dirty & sweaty.\nYou can\u2019t be allergic to pets or teenagers (I know there are some people that are).\nI take life as it comes because I figure it is to be enjoyed. If you are flexible and fun and cuddly, than e-mail me.\nWhat I am looking for in a new relationship is commitment, honesty, communication, appreciation, respect; which all are important.I\u2019m looking for someone who knows that true love means working together through the good times and the bad. Trust, respect and honest open communication is important to me", "email": " ryandad0361@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "connectingsingles", "matchdoctor", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["RyanDad81.jpg", "RyanDad82.jpg", "RyanDad83.jpg", "RyanDad84.jpg", "RyanDad85.jpg", "RyanDad86.jpg"]}
