I know communication is part of a healthy relationship. Without it relationship is doom for failure. I have no problem listen to someone I love. I am looking for a man that is as tired of playing games as I am. The past several relationships thah I have been in move along fine to a certain point. It seems like once you near that serious commitment stage that people tend to turn tail and run. This is what has happened to me. People say they want a serious committed relationship but when you get to that point, they bail out. The man I am looking for should know what he wants and be very good in communicating. he should be good at expressing his opinions and feelings to his mate as well as be good at listening. Communication is very important in a relationship. Also, he should be able to put his relationship first as it should be the one of the most important things in his life.", "email": " morganelizabeth966@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["elizabethmorgan1.jpg"]}
