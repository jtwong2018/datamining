Maybe so. But as crazy as it sounds, I want to believe in fairy tales and I want to believe in love. I still hope that chivalry isn\u2019t dead. I want a woman I can relax in, dream with and cheer on. I want a princess charming that I can build with. I still believe there is at least one woman out there who is honest, faithful and true. Surely there is a woman of conviction and integrity that still walks the earth. If you are \u201cher,\u201d then please return with my glass slipper so we can meet the exciting future that awaits us.\nSending BIG hugs and a little \u201cmagic\u201d your way,", "email": " rahel@angelic.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "military scammer", "Steve Jones"], "gender": "male", "images": ["rahelek1.jpg"]}
