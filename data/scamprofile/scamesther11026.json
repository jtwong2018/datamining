I also walk and Meditation to keep my body, mind and soul clean, healthy and happy. I love traveling but haven\u2019t seen many Lands of this world.. I believe that we are children still at heart, capable of wonder, revelry and change, but, something should be stable. I am an intense friend, sees his glass as half full. I have always drawn to Oceans, mountains and nature. when there is good music, I love to dance, I also enjoy art, cultural activities, exploring new places, visiting museums. I also enjoy romantic picnics, candle light dinner. I believe the kiss is the most intimate and sensual thing that two people can share. kissing is an art form. On the more romantic side, I love to cuddle up near the fire, I love to touch and be touched. Throw your dreams in to the sky, like a kite, and you may get a new friend, a new life OR a new LOVE", "email": " b.alice1z@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "female", "images": ["esther110261.jpg", "esther110262.jpg", "esther110263.jpg", "esther110264.jpg"]}
