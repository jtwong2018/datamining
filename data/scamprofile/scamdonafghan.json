I do not believe that a lady is a personal piece of property and can be done what one likes to do! The lady in my life would be my equal and I would always uphold her with the greatest respect. I still believe in chivalry!!! A gentleman should always hold the door open for his lady (for that matter any woman) and will be proud to walk the streets with her on my arm!!! No, chivalry is not dead! I tend to put everything into a relationship and not go into half-heartedly! Am I opening up Pandora Box because of this? Yes, if the other one is not sincere, but no, if they are!!! You can only get out of a relationship with what you put into it.", "email": " donafghans@yandex.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["donafghan1.jpg", "donafghan2.jpg", "donafghan3.jpg"]}
