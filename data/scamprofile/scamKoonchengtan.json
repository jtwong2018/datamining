I love to be around like minds, chilling and talking about every aspect of life. I\u2019m an advocate of love but not senseless about it. Anyways, everyone else has his/her own understanding of it. I\u2019m free, so open that you can see through my transparency. Although we write a lot of things about us, doesn\u2019t mean we are actually that way or may not translate into real life.
