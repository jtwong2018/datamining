Someone who is not chained to their job, their computer or cell phone would be a plus. Nothing wrong with being a go-getter, but there has to be a good balance, don\u00b4t you think? Someone who is mature, responsible and intelligent. Someone who puts butterflies in my stomach. Someone who effortlessly makes me laugh. Someone who isn\u00b4t afraid to make a decision if needed. It would be nice to find a relationship where each person\u00b4s personality and attitude compliments the other. I also think building upon a friendship first is the way to go. I would describe myself as a kind, generous, easy-going person. I love to laugh and enjoy funny situations. I enjoy traveling and the adventures of the outdoors. Getting away is important because I think everyone should see what else is out there. I also like going to the movies, theater, concerts, museums or a nice restaurant. But I am just as happy staying home and hanging out friends and family. I would like to meet someone who has similar interests, but who can introduce different activities into my life.", "email": " scottpearls147@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["syder1471.jpg"]}
