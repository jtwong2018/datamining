I love good food, outdoors, spending time with friends and family, and being in love. I like to make the most of each day, and I don\u2019t take life for granted. I love to cook so you won\u2019t go to bed hungry. I can fix your cloths and make a new one if needed. I can take care of myself and provide for the family\u2019s basic needs. I have everything I need and very happy with where I am at in my career. But what I am really missing very much is a woman who will complement me. A woman without drama, who can speak up what is on her mind freely, not be afraid to take a risk, understands that the world is not black and white and there are various shades of gray and accept this. I want to find a womn that I can come home to and just be a woman. Who understands that his lady can be tired sometimes and sometimes needs a strong shoulder to lean on. The one who understand that everything can not always be perfect and be OK with it.
