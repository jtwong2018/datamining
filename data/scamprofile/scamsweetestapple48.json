I would describe myself also as a family woman. I think family is at the center of everything. If you meet the perfect woman, would you want to settle down? I seek my perfect match to marry! I will serve you breakfast in bed on a lazy Sunday morning, doesn\u2019t that sound nice? People have described me as serious, and I take that as a compliment. I like to think of myself as very responsible, I always think about things properly before acting. I am quite a confident woman, I know what I\u2019m looking for in life and how to get it. My work takes up a lot of time for me, people often say that I\u2019m a real workaholic.", "email": " donellanilus@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sweetestapple481.jpg"]}
