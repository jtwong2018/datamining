I understand it is important to lay down lasting foundations for a lasting relationship. I love poetry, books, walks on the beach and cozy candlelight dinners. I enjoy movies, television, music, traveling, the quietness of the mountains, the ocean, sunrises and sunsets. I am looking for a special, loving relationship with a unique Woman who is affectionate, beautiful inside, sincere, easy going, with interests and characteristics similar to mine and even closer. Someone who wants a meaningful, serious, long-term relationship, not just a few dates. I can be a friend you will always like to keep me around you. I like to crack jokes and make people around me feel happy. I am a really fun person who loves people, loves to laugh, I am very caring,love music, dancing and singing .. I am a devoted friend. I like to have fun, I have strong moral values with honesty and integrity being the core of my personality, am very cool, i respect my dignity\u2026.\nI\u2019m excited to see new places, meet new people and do new things.
