I always respect people, and their opinions. I don\u2019t like to judge and to be judged. I love animals. My friends always say that I\u2019m a great listener and also good as an intermediate between people. I like rain, and especially the smell of wet soil. I don\u2019t have any pets, but I want to have a cat.", "email": " mercyjames45@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["BrownWilliam1.jpg"]}
