I\u2019m looking for someone with aspirations of growing, learning and always becoming a better person. I\u2019m friendly with a big heart. I like open-minded people who aren\u2019t quick to judge others. A person who\u2019s laid back, compassionate, and has a great sense of humor is right up my alley. I\u2019d say I\u2019m an ambitious too and get along with everybody. Someone who can hold a conversation and can express who they truly are is something I am very attracted to.", "email": " harrison.duana@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["harrisond1.jpg"]}
