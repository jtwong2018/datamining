Here I am, just testing the waters to see who is out there. I really enjoy meeting people in the real world but am giving online a try. I\u2019d like to find that beautiful type of relationship where life can be shared on a deeper level. I\u2019m looking for someone who is genuine, intelligent and has a good sense of humor \u2013 being genuine is very important for me. An ideal long-term relationship is easy to maintain, involves lively discussions, engages our friends and family around us, contains laughter and a mutual pursuit of our passions. I\u2019m unique in that I will not waste time with \u201cshallow\u201d interactions. I\u2019m only open to meaningful, honest, and exclusive relationships with like minded people. I\u2019m not concerned with having tons of friends. A few good friends is all I need. I know it\u2019s hard to get to know someone by just a few photos and a couple of paragraphs, so if you want to get to know me better you should message me. Basically I love life and I love living life. I enjoy the outdoors, traveling, restaurants, laughing, going to cultural events, and socializing with quality people. Its just better living and sharing life with someone else. If you\u2019d like to know more Say \u201chi\u201d. I didn\u2019t reveal a lot about my Self for you to read on purpose. Rather we chat, talk, engage in conversation to get to know each other instead of us reading through a long page in this section about each other. Also, just because someone looks like a good match \u201con paper\u201d, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate in reality. P.S. If I send you a message and you happen to read it, please either let me know. Even if you are not interested, just say so. You won\u2019t offend me, I promise.", "email": " alingard14@mail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["aeaton14141.jpg"]}
