I see myself as someone that is shy and casual. I am secure and happy with myself, but life is meant for two! I am looking for that special someone who makes my heart flutter when I see her. A woman who I can treat like a new born baby. I want to walk on the beach holding hands and sit by the born fire at night or by the lake after a long hike. I enjoy comedy clubs, live music and celebrating special occasions. I am hard working, confident, honest and I have a great sense of humor. Family & friends are very important to me. I guess the woman that I am looking for is someone that enjoys the simple things in life. Very easy going. I like sports, movies and classic country music. I\u2019m a very romantic, affectionate and caring man. I love learning and self-growth, becoming a better version of a human each day. More than anything I love spending time outdoors, surrounded by nature where a person feels almost overwhelmed by the beauty of God\u2019s creation.", "email": " brock.guillermo67@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "oasis"], "gender": "male", "images": ["bguillermo1.jpg"]}
