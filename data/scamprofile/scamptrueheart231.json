I look like my pictures, love my family, am gainfully employed and smell good. I am intelligent, fashionable, sensitive to others, well mannered, a good provider, have great values, am personable, sexy and grounded and want the same in a significant other. I\u2019ll always hold the door for you and don\u2019t do drugs, unless you count green tea. Being single is fine and I certainly don\u2019t think that one should be in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship but life is too short to go through alone and being in love is the best. I am open to finding that and if i find it via the online model, it would be convenient, like ordering relationship take out. \ud83d\ude42 I won\u2019t be too detailed on my dating resume as I think it will be a bit more interesting to get to know the specifics through conversation, no? I\u2019m assuming what I am saying will click with someone I like on here, but who am I kidding we all look at the pictures first and sometimes you just fall for who you fall for and all rules go out the window.", "email": " rebelluv41@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "dateagolfer", "facebook", "ilikeyou", "Lia19"], "gender": "female", "images": ["ptrueheart2311.jpg", "ptrueheart2312.jpg", "ptrueheart2313.jpg", "ptrueheart2314.jpg"]}
