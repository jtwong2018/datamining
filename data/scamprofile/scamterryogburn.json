I can be very appealing if you turn the lights down low, squint and imagine I am Terry. I\u2019ve heard women say they would like their man to be like their bra \u2013 supportive. I think most men just want to be the bra. Luckily, I am not like most men who just want to get into your pants. I have no desire to cross dress. I\u2019m serious about wanting to meet someone special. I\u2019ll jump on Oprah\u2019s couch when I do. If you would like to meet a guy with an IQ bigger than his shoe size, we should talk.", "email": " terryogburn222@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["terryogburn1.jpg", "terryogburn2.jpg"]}
