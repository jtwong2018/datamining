I enjoy my work and love to travel. I am serious but also have a distinct sense of humor. Adjectives that friends have used to describe me: nice, down-to-earth, passionate, intellectual, romantic, sensual, unpretentious, relaxed or intense: appropriate to the situation. I enjoy dining in or out, theater, spending time with friends, family and many other activities. I am looking to meet someone special with whom I can build a strong relationship leading to marriage and family. I am looking for a relationship based on trust between two people who are committed to growing together over time. Mutual acceptance, support and caring; with passion and lots of fun. Time spent together doing new and exciting things, quietly doing our own thing or in activities that we both enjoy. Eventually settling into a comfortable relationship where good communication skills help us deal with the inevitable bumps in the road along the way.", "email": " Robin_hood1960@ymail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Robin1.jpg", "Robin2.jpg"]}
