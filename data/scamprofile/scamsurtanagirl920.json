Which, if you knew me when I was a child, is the complete opposite. I\u2019ve been told I was the \u201cloud annoying child\u201d when I was younger. Well I\u2019m not like that anymore. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I can get loud. And I love to laugh. But for the most part over the years, I\u2019ve become the quiet solitary girl, that sticks to her closest friends. I like to read\u2026alot. And I love to play video games and watch anime\u2026in fact I tend to obsess over some. But that\u2019s besides the point I would like to find someone who wants to spend time getting to know me. I am a ole fashioned girl who loves to be treated like a lady . I love walks in the park or just spending time together watching a love story cuddling on the couch. I do believe in true love and love at first sight. Love is something you cherish and never take for granted . I would love to find a man that is as passionate about love and life as I am\u2026.", "email": " riverstreams27@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "militarycupid", "romance scammer", "tagged"], "gender": "female", "images": ["surtanagirl9201.jpg"]}
