Am cute, sweet and all that you will ever need in a woman.Well, I am a girl some of the time, a woman to others, and I choose to act the way I feel. I like to get muddy, I love to look sexy, I love to double over in laughter. I suppose I am just like most of you. I am 5.8 . I have long Brown hair, Brown eyes and definiatly walk with a strut. I am free spirited, I love to travel, and I am not afraid to be alone. I love intellectual conversations that leave you with a good smile, but I also love the conversations you would never tell anyone about, just because they are plain \u201cnot right\u201d. I dont exactly know if I could pin down the specific characteristics that I require in a partner, but I do know this . I never want to loose my love for life, I want someone who can take a hit and pick themselves back up again.", "email": " p.tracy1411@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "romance scammer", "Yuliana Avalos"], "gender": "female", "images": ["patwantlove1.jpg"]}
