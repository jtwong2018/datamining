I\u2019m looking for someone I can talk to, make a connection, share views, thoughts and see what grows. I love going to the gym (once I get there, lol), seaching for the perfect waterfall in the mountains and quiet times with someone special. A good day to me is being at the beach, the sun shinning down, the breeze gently blowing, listening to the waves crashing, the children laughing and watching the birds plan their stategy for the next chip. I am a hopeless romantic. Passion is a must. It is sad to me how people forget the importance of touch, eye contact and conversation. If you were to ask my friends what stands out about me it would probably be that I have a heart of gold. Depending on the friend you ask, lol. There is no greater treasure to me than friendship. Friendship is the foundation of our being. Hard times come and go but if you have a strong foundation it will last thru most anything. There is no drama or baggage in my life. My child is grown and live on her own in college. I am self sufficient. I work hard every day to maintain my independence. The only thing missing is companionship.", "email": " fred_addison90@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "connectingsingles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Fredfun901.jpg", "Fredfun902.jpg"]}
