However I look younger. Lol! I am fun and can be outgoing. I do like being a homebody . I am searching for a real relationship . I want a man who enjoys coming home to his lady. I want a man who can appreciate a woman who is loyal and committed. A man who is understanding and compassionate. I am a honest person and would like a honest man. I am not perfect I know you arent perfect either. However we could be perfect for one another. I can cook and I enjoy dining out. I like church and occasionally a cocktail. I like making friends and attending new events festivities arts galleries . I most enjoy reading alone or to my mate. I am 5&quot;7 weight 115. Average built. Attractive to a man eyes. Ive been heartbroken and I dont want that ever again. I wish I could meet a man and we just jump right in a relationship loving each other respecting one another making each of us happy and the feeling of being wanted . I know this is a long shot But a long shot is all I have left. Ive decided if this doesnt work If I cant find a man with morals values respect for women and the relationship we share. If there is not one man who is tired of games lies and all the bull crap who wants a relationship that is solid and strong", "email": " annebrady2016@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "flirthut", "someonenew"], "gender": "female", "images": ["annehelen1.jpg"]}
