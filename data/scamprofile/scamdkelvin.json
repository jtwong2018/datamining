Even though I\u2019m busy working 5 days a week (like most people), I feel like something is missing. I would like to find somebody who is looking to find somebody who wants to hear about the small things that go on every day as well as the bigger conversations about life. So many people know just a piece of who we are, but wouldn\u2019t it be nice to find somebody you could tell anything to and know that they are interested in hearing about it. Whether it\u2019s sharing a spat with a coworker or talking about hopes and fears for the future, it would be nice knowing that somebody is listening and wants to listen.
