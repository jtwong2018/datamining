Once I decide to get involved with someone or something, I jump in with both feet and get fully engaged. Family and friends follow closely behind and then there\u2019s the things I do for fun: snow skiing, mountain biking, racing, and great food. I\u2019m looking for someone smart, fun-loving but focused on the important things in his life. I also enjoy a quiet evening with a good meal and a bottle of wine, dining out with friends, working out, watching movies and watching sports. I\u2019m looking for someone that shares my passion for conversation and time together, whether a quiet evening at home, dinner with friends or attending a football game. I believe chivalry still has a place in our society and saying that doesn\u2019t make me a sexist, that the sexiest thing about a woman is his brain; and, of course, a nice smile is important too!", "email": " barasmatai@mail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["bantyphage1.jpg", "bantyphage2.jpg", "bantyphage3.jpg", "bantyphage4.jpg"]}
