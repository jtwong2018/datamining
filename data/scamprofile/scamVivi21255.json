I don\u2019t know what my perfect match would be I want honesty and trust, fun loving and outgoing, loves children and understands the demands they place in life Ive been a single for many years now.\nA few things to get out of the way first (in no particular order):\n* Employed\n* Own my own home (Not with the mortgage company)\n* No drugs\n* Not a player\n* Emotionally available (Very Romantic)\n* Not looking for one-night stands\nI am old enough to know better but young enough to do it again. I miss that feeling you get when you cannot wait to see or call that someone who gives your stomach butterflies. I want that feeling again and show someone some love(I want my love life back). I am looking for a best friend, companion and lover. It would be great to have someone to cuddle with, whether it is cold outside or not.\nI desire a man with a sense of humor, independent, confident, intelligent, imaginative, caring, fun loving and above all honest. A man who wants to be in an equal partnership, one who believes in common (like responding to an email or wink,even if it is a &quot;thanks, but no thanks&quot;), the &quot;golden rule&quot; and hopes chivalry is not dead (there are a few of us left out there). There seems to be a lot of that missing in the &quot;online world&quot;. If you only really want a &quot;pen pal&quot;, and don\u2019t plan on meeting, be upfront about it\u2026.", "email": " Viviandersen2003@outlook.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Vivi212551.jpg"]}
