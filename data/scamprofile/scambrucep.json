I\u2019m also accepting and loyal, rather adventurous, curious about the world, serious but with a playful side. I like being in both natural surroundings and in the city; going out to eat, whether upscale or to some little place that may surprise and delight. Also enjoy going to museums, galleries, the theatre, fairs, antique stores or anywhere that\u2019s interesting \u2013 even the occasional rocket launch. I love to go dancing, stargazing, hiking, canoeing, swimming, exploring new areas, any kind of movie as long as it\u2019s well-written, and just relaxing. My favorite is having great conversation over a great meal, talking about anything and everything and learning from and about each other. I\u2019m fine on my own, but everything would be so much more enjoyable having someone to share with. Getting boring doing things solo all the time\u2026.\nI am quiet, friendly and known for my smile. I mostly have a positive outlike on life and take things as they come\u2026. There is a reason for everything, I believe even though it may not seem to make sense at the time!\nI am looking for someone who is easy going, who enjoys one on one time with a partner but who also has independent interests. I respond well to someone who is kind and respectful and open-minded\u2026..", "email": " brucepknaup@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["brucep1.jpg", "brucep2.jpg", "brucep3.jpg", "brucep4.jpg", "brucep5.jpg"]}
