I am a fun loving woman who loves to have a good time, and fully believe that laughter truly is the best medicine.However, that said, I do know when and where to be serious and respect that trait in others as well.I enjoy a wide range of activities from your stereotypical walk on the beach to something more offbeat like painting in the park. Generally I consider myself to be very open to new experiences and will try almost anything once.Really though, I think fun comes from who you are with rather than what you are doing. Good company can make what would have been a mundane experience a great time.I look forward to seeing what the future will bring with the right person and am optimistic that I will find someone to spend my life with. However at this time I just want to take things slow and have some fun times with a fantastic man.", "email": " habeeb793@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "Destiny Moody", "facebook", "love scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["montalbaby111.jpg", "montalbaby112.jpg", "montalbaby113.jpg", "montalbaby114.jpg", "montalbaby115.jpg", "montalbaby116.jpg", "montalbaby117.jpg"]}
