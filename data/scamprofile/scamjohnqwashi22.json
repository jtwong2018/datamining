I understand it is important to lay down lasting foundations for a lasting relationship. I am not interested in games or drama.\nI like getting out and checking out local talent and live concerts, here or anywhere. I enjoy movies and music for relaxation. A quiet night at home is also enjoyed and welcomed. I am open to try different activities and up for the challenge..\nI consider myself to be a fairly honest and truthful person and expect the same in return; I don\u2019t expect someone to attempt to deceive me or \u201cplay\u201d me.\nI believe that time spent apart helps keep things fresh in a relationship and makes the time we DO spend together even better. I\u2019m not one who cheats in a relationship; one man is enough trouble ; I don\u2019t have the time or energy to juggle 2, 3, or 4 at the same time", "email": " johnqwashi22@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "hangouts"], "gender": "male", "images": ["johnqwashi221.jpg", "johnqwashi222.jpg"]}
