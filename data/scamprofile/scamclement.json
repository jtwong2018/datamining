I like camping, fishing, cycling, biking , movies, golf, all kinds of sports.like the indoors too but I\u2019m mostly an outdoorsy, i also like the city life.I take a walk out when the weather\u2019s mild, but go to the pool or mostly the beach when it\u2019s sunny\u2026I enjoy the outdoors, especially the beach. Walking on the beach at night, waves crashing restlessly, a million stars in the sky, ahhh perfect for me.I also like dining out, plays, movies, art..I\u2019m pretty flexible as far as activities..I would like someone that will love and respect me for who I am, that likes to hold my hand and surprise me with a little kiss when I least expect it, or give me a wink from across the room to let me know she\u2019s thinking about me or give me a call just to let me know she\u2019s thinking about me\u2026Because I will be doing the same..I would love someone who is fun to be around, likes to laugh, joke around, enjoy being outdoors going for long romantic walks, enjoys looking at the stars at night, and watching the sun set and rise over the ocean..", "email": " clement_j16@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["clement1.jpg"]}
