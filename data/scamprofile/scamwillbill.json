I would like to find an intelligent, attractive lady that enjoys dinners in the city or finding that great place in the smaller towns nearby, going to movies, finding new places of interest, adventures and looking into each others eyes and being with someone that cares about you. I am very grounded and know what I want. So, okay, I\u2019m a little picky, but if you are that special someone, you can share a relationship with a guy that will always be there for you and will be your best friend. We will have a great time filled with laughter, caring and all that goes with it. I will not play games and if you do please move on. If you love to travel, then I\u2019m your guy. If you are looking for an honest guy that is a true gentleman, send me an email.", "email": " williamsforster58@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "hangouts", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["willbill1.jpg"]}
