I like to give more than I like to receive but I don\u2019t expect more than honesty and faithfulness. I think communication, trust, and honesty are a must in any relationship, whether it be friends or more. I enjoy going out to dinner/movie as well as staying indoors with that special someone. I enjoy a walk in the park, a nice picnic, watching the sunset, etc. I enjoy the small things in life. I have a good sense of humor, very attentive, and love to laugh and have fun.\nI look at internet dating as a way to introduce ourselves. I think getting to know someone should be done face-to-face. For me there\u2019s less pressure to meet someone I haven\u2019t built up in my head over several emails.", "email": " lauraandrew941@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "josiemodel"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Marybrace9411.jpg"]}
