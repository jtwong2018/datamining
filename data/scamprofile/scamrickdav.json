I\u2019m very out going, I like to meet new people and see new things.I am a wonderful cook and prepare great dishes, perhaps I could cook you a meal?I like most any kinds of music, but not a fan of much rap. I love live music and concerts and would love to see a live play or maybe try out an opera one day. I enjoy a lot of outdoor and indoor activities and really enjoy just having fun!I love horses, animals in general, just being around horses in general. I love to go fishing, I love swimming, camping, and riding on 4 wheeler. I guess you could call me a fun frick. I have never been married and do not have any children. I do want to be married one day when I find \u201cMs. Right\u201d and would love to have children of my own, that being said, I am quite open and happy to date a single lady. I am great with children and enjoy being around them.I am looking for a woman who wants to date and take it serious. I am tired of games that some women like to play", "email": " rickdavid77@gmx.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["rickdav1.jpg", "rickdav2.jpg", "rickdav3.jpg", "rickdav4.jpg", "rickdav5.jpg"]}
