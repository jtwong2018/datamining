Oh, of course there has to be some kind of physical attraction of course but that is not the only part of a person, I am good and kind and loving, I am always there to give help to anyone who needs it.I am honest, dependable, loving, gentle, affectionate and have good friendship. I feel that a WOMAN is GOD\u2019s undeserved gift to MAN and she is supposed to be loved, reverenced, protected, respected, and cherished.. I would love someone who is fun to be around, likes to laugh, joke around, enjoy being outdoors going for long romantic walks, enjoys looking at the stars at night, and watching the sun set and rise over the ocean\u2026", "email": " rayperry62@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Rayperry621.jpg"]}
