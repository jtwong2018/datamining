To find that one special woman or as you say \u201cbeloved partner in life\u201d with whom I can share everything\u2013unite my heart, body and soul. That one special woman who will cherish and respect me, with all my imperfections, as much as I will always cherish and respect her.That one special woman who thinks of me as Her Prince.This would be a dream come true,I am looking for someone who is secure and who knows what they want in a man. I want someone who is not afraid of commitment, someone who can communicate well, both with words and feelings, and someone who will treat me as an equal and not an object. A good sense of humor, outgoing, likes horses, and all other animals too. A romantic person and someone who is not afraid to cook dinner once in a while. Someone who will walk beside me and not in front of or behind me. Someone who loves kids, travel, and is able to get dirty one minute and put on a suit and tie, to go out the next minute. Diversity, maturity, stability in their job, and just an all-around good woman.", "email": " tom.hall31@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "topface"], "gender": "male", "images": ["tomhallbarry1.jpg", "tomhallbarry2.jpg", "tomhallbarry3.jpg", "tomhallbarry4.jpg", "tomhallbarry5.jpg", "tomhallbarry6.jpg"]}
