To me happiness is having someone to love and to be loved by someone. I want to meet a wonderful woman who will love me for who i am, there is nothing more special than having someone special in your life.\nI am a person with an intense passion for life. I try and live each day with the understanding that each moment is too precious. My friends would describe me as honest, funny, sarcastic, generous and loyal.This is the first time I have ever tried anything of this nature. I have always felt that my soul mate is somewhere out there, but not necessarily in my area. So I thought this would be a great way to meet new people. I am sweet, compassionate, loving and a romantic at heart.", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "tagged"], "gender": "male", "images": ["amandaryan521.jpg", "amandaryan522.jpg"]}
