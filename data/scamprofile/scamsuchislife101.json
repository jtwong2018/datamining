I am a very caring and sensitive person, I am a level headed, down to earth person who is totally devoted to the one I love. I tend to be shy at first, but I will open up quickly with the right person.I am confident, calm, and happy. An introvert by nature, I am quiet, structured, and organized. i think I\u2019m a pretty easy going person. I love to be shown affection and don\u2019t have any problem whatsoever showing the right person lots of of it, i always say if its better to give than to receive. I think that i have a pretty &quot;strange&quot; sense of humor at times. i look at it this way I\u2019d rather make a joke than to sit around and dwell on things i can\u2019t do much of anything about.I literally despise people who put on or lie about things and think they can get away with it where I\u2019m concerned.", "email": " godfreygeorge70@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "brideru", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["suchislife1011.jpg"]}
