I love to be close to somebody whether it is in the bed,on the couch or wherever.I don\u2019t play games with peoples feelings or emotions nor do i put up with people playing with my feelings.I\u2019m one of those guys that actually likes going to the malls. I enjoy watching the people. Kids having fun is a wonderful thing to see. I like walking along holding hands, stopping for a pretzel or maybe just tossing a coin in the fountain to make a wish.
