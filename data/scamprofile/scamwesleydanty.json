But it\u2019s okay anyway as they always like hanging around me. I am not interested in casual acquaintances or more friends. If am looking for friends they lie everywhere. I am looking to a forever commitment, a one life stand love. I want to meet a woman who is interested in a real long term relationship and to enjoy the trills that go with it. Holidays, romantic meals, cuddling up and watching D VD\u2019s. I have 1 kid who is with me half of the time and I love every minute I get to spend with her. We\u2019re a Christian family and active in the practice of Gods work. My family and friends are important to me and we spend a lot of time with them. I love the symphony, exploring museums, and quiet nights eating popcorn and watching a good movie.\nLike a typical dad i work hard and looking to similar. I\u2019m not a shy introverted guy- but am not an extroverted male either that has to show off. Am just somewhere in the middle confident and a little cheeky! SMILES I have a vast array of interests ranging from arts and crafts to photography, and many more I can\u2019t even think of right now. Now on to travel I like exploring things and places new to me, be it local or in a far away land. Needed more have either really\u2026 well there is so much to say but my mind just went blank.
