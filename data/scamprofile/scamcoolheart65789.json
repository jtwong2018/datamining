I like a woman who is not afraid to show her love and grab me and give me a big hug and a kiss. I like when i pick her up from work, and can even mush her until she says OK! get away from me\u2026.lol\u2026!!!\nI love my life right now and am excited about sharing meaningful conversation, dancing, and outings with a soul mate. I enjoy knowing someone on a deeper level and connecting in such a way that I feel as if I\u2019ve known them all my life.\nI laugh at myself and life\u2019s funny situations. I believe in honest and open communication. I admire authenticity in others and believe it is necessary for a great relationship. I think there has to be compromises from time to time in order to bring about resolution.\nIt is my opinion that we all want the same thing in regards to a partner, and that most of us either do not know how or is scared to and sabotage themselves from getting it. I\u2019m willing to listen and desire to be heard. I think it\u2019s essential to learn one\u2019s love language to bring about a true connection. I am optimistic about having something real with someone but realistic in knowing it takes work and commitment.\nMy life is good and it has been my faith that has brought me this far and is the foundation of all I am.", "email": " thompsonlaura411@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["coolheart657891.jpg", "coolheart657892.jpg", "coolheart657893.jpg", "coolheart657894.jpg", "coolheart657895.jpg"]}
