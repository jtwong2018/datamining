For relaxation, I read books, watch a little TV, long walks, swim and spend time with my daughter.I work out 3 \u2013 4 times a week, I feel it is important to keep my self healthy. I am not a gym fanatic..I just want to be there for my partner in the future.I enjoy live sports, movies, concerts and wine tastings. I do not smoke, that is not a deal breaker for me. lol. I do enjoy drinking wine. I really don\u2019t drink any other alcoholic beverages other than a very occasional beer. My schedule is pretty consistent. I do work on contract basis so I usually work Saturday but am off most Sundays and one other week day. I am presently not dating anyone, I am new to on-line dating.
