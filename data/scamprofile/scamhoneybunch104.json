A generous heart and kind spirit; confident to a fault at times, but a quiet confidence; humbled by my successes and failures; old school romantic looking to WOW and be WOW\u2019ed by the right woman. I am insatiably curious, creative, ambitious, hard-working and unconventional in my attitudes and values \u2013 the consummate outside the box thinker. I am fiercely loyal and supportive.\nHow I feel about the Church\u2026\nI believe Jesus Christ is literally the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer, who died for the sins of humankind and rose from the dead on the third day with an immortal body. God, the Father, also has an immortal body.\nWhat I do for fun\u2026\nI\u2019m an upbeat, active person who has learned to appreciate the basis for happiness which is sharing the enjoyment of the good things and good times with a partner.
