I am just new in the site, I don\u2019t know how to start dating and what to tell you about myself only when you ask me..lol\u2026But I think we can learn a lot about each other and our conversation will be enjoyable.\nThis is my first experience of corresponding in the internet and I don\u2019t even know how to begin our acquaintance. I think that you are an interesting person and we can learn more about each other. I think that you are agreeable companion. Tell me what you think about me. For me, a man\u2019s age, location, look and past life experience is not very important, and the distance between us, easily avoidable if you have a real desire.\nI am a serious and easy going person, I have a tender heart and like to be happy, i am a decent girl with good character and attitude but i am very private. And what about you? I hope that you will respond to my email and tell me things about yourself?\nI\u2019m always honest and sincere. It\u2019s always better to tell the truth, I hope that you will also be sincere with me and I\u2019ll reciprocate. My dream is to create a loving relationship with a responsible man with good heart. I think I have already told too much and I hope that I didn\u2019t scare you? Thanks for your interest and for writing me\u2026 Anyway I was glad to know you and it would be great if we continue our communication. If you have some questions, you are free to ask.
