I enjoy interacting with others but like to relax with family and close friends the most. My interests include reading, the outdoors, walking, swimming, fishing, canoeing, riding my bike for fun, travel, and enjoying new adventures. I enjoy attending church and digging into the word of God through bible study, am socially conservative but fun-loving. No real bucket list but there are fun activities I would enjoy doing in the not-too-distant future i.e. scuba diving and perhaps someone who may consider taking dance lessons with me one day . My cooking is simple, tasty, but healthy yet would enjoy sharing a lovely dessert too \u2026. with a kind, sweet, fun guy that I think is kind of cute.", "email": " karen.debord21@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "facebook", "military scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["karenbaby071.jpg"]}
