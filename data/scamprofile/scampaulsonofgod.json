I am a fun, hardworking, well educated man looking for my better half. I am a recovering workaholic but am learning how to slow down and delegate. I am family oriented and enjoy backyard bbq\u2019s with friends and family. I take exceptional care of my body and am very athletic without overly obsessing over it. Pretty much an adrenaline junkie, I enjoy going to the gym, running, swimming, zip-lining, scuba diving, surfing, tennis, fishing, hunting, riding my horses and golf. Through hard work, life and success have been good to me and it\u2019s now time to share my world and good fortune with a smart, engaging, sweet, sexy woman. I\u2019m looking for a long term relationship no FWBs or one nighters as that is not for me. A strong emotional connection is my aphrodisiac. I\u2019m an excellent cook and you are welcome to find out for yourself\nam looking for well-educated, well-mannered, intelligent, responsible, honest, reliable, cheerful, respectful and optimistic person. My goal is to find my life-partner, to create a happy family\u2026", "email": " paulscort400@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer", "tagged"], "gender": "male", "images": ["paulsonofgod1.jpg"]}
