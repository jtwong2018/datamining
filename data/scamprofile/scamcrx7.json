I approach life in all aspects with great passion; paradoxically, I can find humor in almost everything, especially in myself and some of my foibles. I\u2019m serious but don\u2019t take myself too seriously. If this makes sense to you, we are at least kindred spirits. Ready to find someone with whom I can share the many joys of life as well as the mundane daily stuff that is part of life also. I like affection, giving and receiving.Up to exploring new experiences together or with friends.Definitely NOT interested in over-jealous, possessive personalities!
