I love to laugh and make others laugh. I\u2019m an artist, and enjoy seeing and studying visual arts. I also love my friends and family, the outdoors, witnessing acts of kindness, the human spirit, fly fishing, and the underdog. I am troubled by injustice, the \u201cisms,\u201d the direction this country has recently taken, what we\u2019re doing to this planet, and the TVs that seem to be everywhere these days.Art and fly fishing are the two hobbies that I\u2019m most passionate about; my raisons d\u2019\u00eatre. I generally work in an oil and gas company but also into mosaic art,I prefer to work from life rather than photos who\u2019s details can easily seduce me into tighter painting. I paint mostly people, portraits, and the figure.\nI began fishing when I was three years old, and fishing is a part of my DNA. Moving water grabs me at my core, and pulls me towards it. It\u2019s primal. But my need to fish is usually satiated by quality rather than quantity. I practice catch-and-release.I think I\u2019m reasonable intelligent. I have a Masters degree, and I\u2019m the chief financial officer for a state education agency I don\u2019t live for my work, but I do enjoy it most of the time.\nI like to travel and experience new places and new cultures, but prefer traveling with a partner or alone rather than a tour group. I\u2019m a Yankanuck-a dual citizen of the US and Canada. For me, travel doesn\u2019t have to be around the globe to be interesting and worthwhile. It\u2019s much more about listening, seeing, and engaging a place and its people on their terms rather than on my own.France and the French people hold a special place in my heart. Their food, wine and bread are not to bad either. The first place I fished at age was on the Seine River in Vaux sur Seine, France. I\u2019ve returned to France several times and each visit adds to the love I have for this treasure.\nMaking and eating good food is important to me, and another way to experience other cultures. Cooking for others is also one way I express love. I enjoy wine and wine tours, but my palate is not particularly sophisticated. I enjoy dancing but again, not particularly sophisticated, swing mainly.\nSo how obvious is it that this is my first profile? Yeah, that\u2019s what I thought. Ok, I\u2019m tired of starting sentences with \u201cI\u201d so I\u2019ll leave it here for now.Well, I\u2019ve done some editing this morning. I guess we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s an improvement or not.Let me tell you a little about what I\u2019m looking for in a woman. Mind you, my range of acceptable traits is much broader if we are to be just friends. I\u2019m looking for an equal partner, lover, friend, and companion. She should be honest, intelligent, considerate of others, willing to be vulnerable, independent, and a woman of substance. I don\u2019t need a mother, housekeeper, cook, or laundress. I can do all those things and and capable of sharing the load. I not really interested in overly judgmental, dependent, or opaque individuals.", "email": " billtaylor280@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "hangouts", "letsdate", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["billlovesfun1.jpg", "billlovesfun2.jpg", "billlovesfun3.jpg"]}
