I can enjoy the entire morning on a gentle hike then wander through eclectic shops, or put in a couple of hours of work and visit friends as I make my way home. I enjoy many activities, but my most favourites include walks, gardening, volunteering, yoga, listening to music, baking, ongoing education, road trips and travelling. I\u2019ll always have a pet. Right now I have a cat who acts as the welcoming ambassador to our home.\nAn average day for me is an early breakfast and coffee at the beach\u2026I find it humbling and enlightening to witness nature as it wakes up. When the sun reaches the right hue of light, I photograph creations left behind on the beach, and practice my composition and selfies!\nOn \u201crainy\u201d days, I cozy in with a nice cup of tea and read, or have a popcorn-movie evening. I decided it\u2019s time to start sewing again, learn to weave and to play the keyboard. I talked to a music instructor about missing notes, he said, don\u2019t worry about it, how you think jazz was invented! Good perspective!\nI\u2019m seriously interested in a partner who has my best interest at heart, a partner who\u2019s also comfortable receiving pure love. I\u2019m also open to new supportive friendships. As I evolve, I become more and more comfortable with myself and enjoy being wonderfully, mysteriously average. How\u2019s that for one of life\u2019s contradictions! Let\u2019s talk if my interests or anything I said are complementary with your interests.", "email": " timothw104@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sweetbels851.jpg"]}
