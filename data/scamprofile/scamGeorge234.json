Instead I\u2019m the quiet watchful, listener who will provide you with a listening ear after a tough day, and not judge, or assume or tell you what to do. I love nature, and water and feel a especial kinship to just being near water and having water right near my home. I feel the peace of the world in the breeze cross the water, the lapping of the waves on the shore, the unassuming nature of water and nature. I am one with nature, and could spend hours just sitting by the beach, river, lake,ocean and stitch, read, listen to music.", "email": " georgeadalberto99@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "metrodate"], "gender": "male", "images": ["George2341.jpg", "George2342.jpg", "George2343.jpg", "George2344.jpg"]}
