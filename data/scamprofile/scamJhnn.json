I think it is important to exercise and eating very healthy meals. I enjoy romantic music and slow dancing as well an fast dancing.lol\u2026 I prefer romantic, attractive, affectionate woman. I believe that romance is a very important part of the relationship. I enjoy woman who are confident with themselves and are not afraid to express themselves in a diplomatic way. I think it is very important that two people want the same thing in a relationship. I believe that this should be discussed and communicated clearly when two people first meet. I do not believe in wasting my time or the other persons time because life is too short. I believe each person should be allowed to be who they are and to be free to give their best for each others mutual benefit. I do not like controlling women who do not communicate well and have agendas or excessive previous baggage. I like women who I can have a good conversation with and we can communicate in a mutually beneficial way.", "email": " gencaroltimmons@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Jhnn1.jpg"]}
