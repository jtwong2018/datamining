I\u2019m funny, strong when I need to be, but soft hearted most of the time. I have a great sense of humor, and a very definite romantic side. love to kiss and hold hands, but I especially like to share\u2026big things, little things, everything\u2026most things are better shared.Agda is 8yrs old and we have been leaving all alone together ever since my wife died I\u2019m emotionally balanced and stable, I have a lot to teach\u2026but a lot to learn\u2026I believe that the day we stop learning is the day we die. I have a lot to give emotionally\u2026but yearn to find someone that can give as much in return.I may not be able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, I\u2019m not faster than a speeding bullet, and I\u2019m not as powerful as a locomotive\u2026but I can cook, and I\u2019m pretty darn handy at fixing things.I\u2019m looking for someone who realizes that the very essence of a good relationship starts with being \u201cin like\u201d before you can ever be \u201cin love\u201d.
