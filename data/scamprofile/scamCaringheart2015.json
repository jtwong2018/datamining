I never lie and will never play games and am looking for someone who is brainy enough and knows how to take care of a very sensible man like me. Someone who knows how important a family would be and she a woman of honor with her own word and actions and not only just making all drawings on internet. My life before has no colors like black and white but right now am trying to add some colors on it, HOPING IT WILL BE A RAINBOW SOON..I\u2019m a Hopeless romantic and I\u2019m loving and sweet type of man and I\u2019m looking the same for my woman.
