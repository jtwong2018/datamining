It take alot to get me angry. I want that in a woman as well. Like I said in my profile. It is all about communication and communication is not just talking but also being able to listen. Not just hear the person but listen and absorb and understand what the person is conveying to you..I love individualism. Don\u2019t become what you think I will like, be yourself and let me like you!!! With this as a foundation all the trust and honesty falls into place. It becomes a given and not something you have to look for or ask for.", "email": " oilgas@inbox.eu", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Michael331.jpg"]}
