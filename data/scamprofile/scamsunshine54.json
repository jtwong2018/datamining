Get familiar with me I will not disappoint you. I have a great mind, and I know how to use this great mind to bring peace and tranquility and sweetness, and a creative approach to a relationship. I\u2019m not a person who likes spirit. You are not a man who likes to argue. I prefer to say the least most of the time. I would prefer to discuss everything, but do not argue about it. This relationship does not get anywhere, it is best to find a compromise and to give each other a big hug. I love to cuddle. It is best to find a compromise. I am looking for a caring and family-oriented man, who will be ready to feel love and share it with me. Hope that you will have a lot of ideas about how to make our life brighter, and all necessary thing we will create and achieve together.", "email": " loriann_neiderer@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["sunshine541.jpg"]}
