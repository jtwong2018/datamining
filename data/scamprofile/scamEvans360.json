My name is Evanz. I\u2019m pretty new at this so I\u2019m not exactly sure what goes. I came across your profile and I must confess it had me intrigued. You sound like a woman who knows what she wants and likes to avoid drama and that is exactly who I want. I must tell you I\u2019m here looking for something serious, which might possibly even lead to marriage sometime in the future, if we click. I\u2019d love to know more about you and see how we get along. Drop me a line if you find this interesting enough. Hope to hear from you soon", "email": " richardevans65@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Evans3601.jpg"]}
