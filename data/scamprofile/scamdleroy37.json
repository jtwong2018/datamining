I\u2019m Self Employed and i manage a Gallery,. I love to travel and my work helps me to see some part of the world..I am a true romantic and believe that there is such a thing as a soul mate, but they are not easily found\u2026 out of millions of people those 2 souls must meet by chance and circumstance. I believe that you should consider your soul mate, your best friend and be able to talk about any and everything,not feel strange if there is silence between you. I feel true love and connection doesn\u2019t require constant talking, as a glance or longing stare says every thing and more than words could ever convey. I believe in holding hands, and public displays of affection, as I would want everyone to know that the person who I am with is truly special to me. I believe that being able to be your true self with someone with out judgment is one of the best things in life.", "email": " dleroy37@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["dleroy371.jpg", "dleroy372.jpg"]}
