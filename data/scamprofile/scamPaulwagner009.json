I try to always be a positive person. I am an energetic and sociable person. I appreciate decency and sincerity in a relationship between a man and a woman. The inner beauty is more important for me than the beauty of appearance. My perception of an ideal , I would like to see near me clever, intelligent, and reliable woman. Which would require my emotional heat, capable to like and respect the man. I believe in what a look or a touch can communicate, without saying a word. I love to dress up for that occasional night out or in my jeans for the casual night. I love watching sports, hosting get togethers, going to the lake. I try to be practical, but sometimes my impractical side wins out\u2026 lol I want to find someone I can respect and admire, that enjoys getting out to live life. Trying new things\u2026 Honesty is first and foremost. Someone that looks on the bright side, likes to Laugh, spend time together holding hands, cuddling during thunderstorms, little touches and kisses. I am a very touchy, feely person. A touch from a special person can speak more than any words. A memory that sparks that deep down yearning to see that special someone\u2026 One day I hope\u2026 Find me\u2026", "email": " paulwagner009@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Paulwagner0091.jpg"]}
