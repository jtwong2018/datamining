Strong, independent, but not domineering.Mother she is from Australia ,and i live in Australia for 4years before i finally return back to England Gosport, London, i have strong family values and nurture my relationship with my family and friends. I believe in honesty \u2013 no matter how cruel \u2013 I would rather deal with the reality than living in a fool\u2019s paradise. I am not easily intimidated, but I am not attracted to load and overbearing people. The strong silent type would attract me more. It would be like watching one of the Art films where few words are spoken but so much is said! I like the occasional good visits with friends but enjoy being just at home watching a good movie and having a glass of wine.", "email": " ks843915@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook"], "gender": "male", "images": ["TravisJP1.jpg", "TravisJP2.jpg", "TravisJP3.jpg"]}
