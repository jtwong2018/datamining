I\u2019m gonna try this one more time. First know my life is always in chaos. I don\u2019t create it it just always is. What I would want the most is a quite life and someone to share it with. When I commit to a relationship it\u2019s 110% I just want that one person to love, to share every aspect of my life with. To be not just a lover but a best friend. I\u2019m very affectionate and love to spend time just cuddling. Being in someone\u2019s arms and just enjoying the closeness.", "email": " jamesmoorecrown1966@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "mingle2"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Jamesmoore19661.jpg"]}
