I live my life with integrity and genuineness in my relationships with others. I have a great sense of humor and can be pretty witty and while I can be serious, I love to laugh and have fun. Generally, I am very understanding, of course related to my training but mostly through my own experience of facing challenges in life and my own maturation. I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s not just \u201cabout me\u201d but the \u201cwe\u201d experience that means the most. I want a partner to share my life. Like most people, my basic visceral attraction is an essential component of my relationships, it is also our ability to communicate verbally in an open and honest way that binds and grows the relationship on-going. I want someone who is genuinely caring and nurturing and with whom I can be vulnerable to love and nurture in return.", "email": " fredrickcrowley001@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["fredrick19601.jpg"]}
