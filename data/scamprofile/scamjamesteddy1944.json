I need to be able to trust this person with my whole heart, I have not found someone like that in My life, every time I think I can open up something happens.I am determined to make this year Drama Free, and go with the flow, so far so good, I have enjoyed this year!!!!!, I spend a lot of time at the ocean, my favorite place to be, I love spending quiet nights at home or going out for a nice dinner, I like the movies, concerts, reading, spending time with family and friends. The one thing I am going to do is take my time finding the rightwoman, I want her to be able to love openly, to be a romantic, to be honest, sincere, caring, I want to be treated like I am the best thing that has ever walked into her life..money, objects, beautiful houses and cars are not important to me, I am not a shallow person, and I am not materialistic. I truly love the simple life.", "email": " teddyjames27@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "netlog"], "gender": "male", "images": ["jamesteddy19441.jpg"]}
