I love to find the pleasure in all things.Laughing, playing sport games, being outdoors, smelling the ocean air, burying my feet in the hot sand of a beach, watching the movement of jelly- fish, listening to the laughter of children, watching the look on their faces as they are learning something new , being protective of those I love and care for, good debates, music of all kinds (well is rap really music though?) , movies (don\u2019t handle horror to well, but with the right person to bury my face in, I might, snuggling deep in her arms.\nLooking for the best in a lady\u2026..I\u2019m an extremely compassionate person.
