Each of us is unique in his own way and yet we can be two missing pieces of a very beautiful puzzle. I am looking for a reliable man. I need a caring and attentive man who is able to appreciate woman\u2019s beauty, soul and fidelity, the one who will give me the sense of security and who I can love the way he has always dreamed about.", "email": " erin.britton00@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "Lauren Loretta", "romance scammer", "veggiedate"], "gender": "female", "images": ["whynot001.jpg", "whynot002.jpg", "whynot003.jpg"]}
