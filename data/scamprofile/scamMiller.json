I am looking forward to that day with all my heart. I am preparing myself for you each day. Imagining what you could be like. What do you look like? Are you tall, and beautiful or are you short, thick, cuddly, and good looking? No matter what, you are for me and I will love you regardless what happens through the times. I hope to grow old with you for the rest of my life. To celebrate good times with you and support each other through the bad times. Marriage is a journey that we will grow together through. We will learn things about each other every day. We will not always have good times but we will always love each other and work through our problems. Marriage is forever. So I promise you forever. We will have fun watching football games, taking walks, and watching movies. I look forward to that day and until then, I will be waiting for you with open arms and my heart full of love just for you.\nLove Always,", "email": " mscott4821@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Miller1.jpg"]}
