Currently, I am trapped in a maze of metro-mess road reconstruction looking for the path to the tower that imprisons your heart. My armor\u2019s shine has dulled from previous battles of the sexes; however, the inflicted wounds have healed with no attached baggage. My motives are good, my heartbeat is sometimes steady, and I have an even chance of continued breathing. Can enjoy almost anything (except line dancing and opera) during the few downtime from my quest of trying to rescue you.", "email": " stewardpope@yandex.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "matchdoctor"], "gender": "male", "images": ["stewardpope1.jpg"]}
