Even then I can be very funny. Also, be \u201cquiet\u201d I do not mean that I don\u2019t talk. By the opposite! Just that I am not laud or \u201cbubbly.\u201d I enjoy long interesting conversations on many topics. In the right setting/context and with the right people, I am very much a people\u2019s person. I have recently learned that I fall in the category of non-shy introvert. I\u2019m also very sensitive and rational, at the same time. Other personality and character traits (according to some people)would be friendly, intellectual, \u201cclassy\u201d, reliable, witty, kind, patient, caring, \u201cold-fashioned\u201d, chivalrous, etc. I don\u2019t like drama, nor mind-games, and definitely stay away from that.", "email": " infoploiceaffair@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "hangouts"], "gender": "male", "images": ["kevin0091.jpg"]}
