I do not believe in fairy tales and happy ends, I believe in sincere relationship and equality between partners. I am quite passionate. However, it is achievable only after applying my mind to relationship and realizing that it is worth it. I may seem distant sometimes, but that is only a mask of female weakness and my past heart wounds. I tend to be steady in relationship and do my best to make this relationship work\u2026. I am a tender and romantic woman. I wish to admit that I am a woman who knows exactly what she needs in her life and doesn\u2019t want to loose time in vain. I like to care about people who are close to me! I have a lot of love in my heart and I want to give it to someone\u2026. I know exactly what I want to get in this life and I am not going to waste time for empty relationship. I am looking for creating happy family with right man. I am interested about relationship with longing perspective. I am intelligent, caring, reliable one. I am usual woman who is looking for usual woman\u2019s happiness. As for me, it means to love and be loved.", "email": " pattybee0240@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles"], "gender": "female", "images": ["blues1.jpg"]}
