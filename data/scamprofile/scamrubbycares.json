I am a very proud father of a daughter. Her mother is late since child birth and it weighs me down, not much but a bit, it doesn\u2019t give me much time to devote time for my work.. Now that my daughter is growing (getting older) i think this open time for me to find a soul-mate, life-long partner on here. Actually this\u2019s my first time on this site and i hope to meet a loving down to heart woman. I love hiking, hunting, riding bike and exploring the world with the help of my job and exposure i had with my late dad", "email": " rolandrubby@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "badoo", "love scammer", "meetup", "metrodate", "mingle2"], "gender": "male", "images": ["rubbycares1.jpg", "rubbycares2.jpg", "rubbycares3.jpg", "rubbycares4.jpg", "rubbycares5.jpg", "rubbycares6.jpg", "rubbycares7.jpg", "rubbycares8.jpg", "rubbycares9.jpg"]}
