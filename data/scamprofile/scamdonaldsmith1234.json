I am a very positive, happy, peaceful person. I love to travel, nature, and getting out for the weekend. I have been meditating and doing yoga for decades. I am free every other weekends, as I have my wonderful daughter on the other weekends. I am very relational. I keep myself physically, emotionally and spiritually healthy and am looking for a friend who wants a healthy relationship (:\nI have had a lot of success in my life and am very confident. I am not materialistic and much prefer to travel and enjoy life, but I do things with the media and you should be comfortable with yourself and enjoy having your partner achieve things, instead of being intimated by the successes. I don\u2019t make a big deal of it. I am a kind, loyal and patient person. I am looking for someone to enjoy this journey of life with.\nSomeone who is responsible, takes good care of themselves,and knows what they want in life. I\u2019m not looking to meet anyone who is selfish, self centered, untidy, or tempered.
