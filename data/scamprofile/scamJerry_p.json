I am very easy going and laid back. I am often told that I am very easy to talk with. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is. Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way I view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows. I have a wonderful Son. I would do best with someone that isn\u2019t extremely uptight, unless of course you are willing to learn to let things go! I love to try new things, and can laugh at myself when I fail miserably. I don\u2019t give up easily, and have so many things I\u2019ve yet to try. Please love to laugh and have fun, what is better than laughing so hard your stomach hurts?!", "email": " jerry_p45@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "confirio", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Jerry_p1.jpg"]}
