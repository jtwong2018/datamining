I am very easy going and laid back. I am often told that I am very easy to talk with. I am not an angry person, and I am not interested in someone that is Having past events shape your life is one thing, carrying the past as a burden that sits heavily upon your shoulders is not the way I view life. I am happy with myself, and my life, and I like to think it shows\u2026I would do best with someone that isn\u2019t extremely uptight, unless of course you are willing to learn to let things go! I love to try new things, and can laugh at myself when I fail miserably. I don\u2019t give up easily, and have so many things I\u2019ve yet to try. Please love to laugh and have fun, what is better than laughing so hard your stomach hurts!! I love traveling, going on unknown adventures, and trying something I thought I never would. I\u2019ll try anything once, well, but fun none the less!
