I learn more about myself everyday and appreciate the simple things in life. I feel that it is so important to be real and true; to be kind and giving. I was very skeptical about internet dating, but what do I have to loose!? It would be nice to meet my ideal match and see where that potentially leads us; a good woman with a humble character; someone just right for me. I absolutely love the water and anywhere that i can be by it especially with someone i care about is a plus. basically i just want someone i can\u2019t live without. distance isn\u2019t an issue for me because i want to find my soul mate and she could be anywhere.", "email": " greglucas41@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "Alan Gray", "confirio", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["greglucas1.jpg"]}
