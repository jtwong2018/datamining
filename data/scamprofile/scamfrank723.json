I have an amazing ten year old daughter. I enjoy going to her activities, the outdoors, the lake, skiing, traveling, restaurants, laughing, going to sporting events, and hanging out with friends. It\u2019s just better living and sharing life with someone else. Yes, I do have a car, my socks match and I always leave the toilet seat in the down position. Ha! I enjoy being active, healthy and staying fit.friends are important to me as well. If you would like to know more\u2026send me an e-mail. I didn\u2019t reveal a lot about myself for you to read on purpose. Rather we chat, talk, engage in conversation to get to know each other instead of us reading through a long page in this section about each other. Also, just because someone looks like a good match on paper, doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into reality.", "email": " frankvennah@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer", "matchdoctor"], "gender": "male", "images": ["frank7231.jpg", "frank7232.jpg"]}
