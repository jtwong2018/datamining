I am a God fearing Christian woman. Never married and never had kids. I want to say also I\u2019m willing to relocate to you as long as your in USA or even maybe Canada. I travel a lot of work but when I meet the right man I\u2019m willing to settled down unless were going on a trip together. If I end up giving you my contact information, it is because I want to really chat. I don\u2019t have much time to be online. I stay busy with work and traveling for work in antiques. So if I give you my contact info and I don\u2019t answer right away I may be busy. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting a great guy for a serious relationship leading to marriage. An I\u2019m open about kids also. I would love to have kids myself but it\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t. I really want to find the right man for me.", "email": " carolinetravislove@gmail.com", "tags": ["Female profiles", "mingle2", "romance scammer", "zoosk"], "gender": "female", "images": ["Foreverlovemine1.jpg", "Foreverlovemine2.jpg"]}
