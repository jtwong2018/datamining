I am a very fun, romantic, kind, loyal, caring, affectionate and bright man, A man that doesn\u2019t care about what you have, but who you are. I am easy going and get along very well with people. I have spent my life waiting \u2026 not living, nor loving, but waiting. Waiting for the one that would inspire me to be all I can be, to live up to every expectation, to reach every goal, to know that I may fail sometime but I will never be alone or waiting again..\nI am looking for my life partner, best friend and lover. A true woman that is very affectionate, passionate, romantic, faithful and caring. she should care more about who she is, rather than what she has. she should be kind and sensitive to my needs and have a love of family. Someone I can laugh, love, cry and share my thoughts and dreams with. A confident woman, but not self absorbed. I am looking for a loyal, faithful, spiritual, sensitive and positive person. she needs to be able to be mentally intimate as well as physically intimate with me and a great sense of humor.", "email": " Scott_jason46@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "metrodate"], "gender": "male", "images": ["scott1.jpg"]}
