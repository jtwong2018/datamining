However, I have made several changes in my life, I had enough of the politics in the education world. I have gone back to the one job that I found enjoyment in, THE ARMY. I reenlisted back in MARCH. Then its off to see the world. Hopefully this time I get to see the world. Life couldn\u2019t be any better than it already is and will be in the future. Life was handing my lemons so I decided to make lemonaid. For all of you wondering why I joined army, I did it because I think that\u2019s what i like most. I actually make more in THE ARMY than doing any job. Also, I have less headaches.", "email": "\u00a0sgt.ryanmcconnell209@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "datememateme", "facebook", "military scammer", "netlog", "tagged"], "gender": "male", "images": ["mcconnellryan1.jpg", "mcconnellryan2.jpg", "mcconnellryan3.jpg"]}
