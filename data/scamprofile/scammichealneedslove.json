Instead I\u2019m the quiet watchful,listener who will provide you with a listening ear after a tough day, and not judge, or assume or tell you what to do. I love nature,and water and feel a special kinship to just being near water and having water right near my home. I feel the peace of the world in the breeze across the water, the lapping of the waves on the shore, the unassuming nature of water and nature. I am one with nature, and could spend hours just sitting by the beach, river, lake, ocean and stitch, read, listen to music and feel at the end of a day that I\u2019ve had an incredible day\u2026\nAsk me more and i would tell you much more\u2026\nI love my son and he is an important part of my life \u2026", "email": " michealmartin2000@gmail.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "matchdoctor"], "gender": "male", "images": ["michealneedslove1.jpg", "michealneedslove2.jpg"]}
