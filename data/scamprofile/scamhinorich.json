I will not say things I don\u2019t mean, especially in a relationship but I also have had to learn how to be assertive and speak the truth in love not be so scared and shy, worrying about what someone might think.It is always good to be up front and honest even if it is difficult. I am a fairly down to earth person and I hope you are beginning to see that. I could never tell anyone I love you if I did not. That is just me.thanks for viewing my profile.", "email": " raymondalter@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "Jeff Miller", "military scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["hinorich1.jpg"]}
