My ultimate goal is to find the perfect for me\u201d someone to share what lies ahead. I\u2019m considered by others to be smart, ambitious, generous, charitable, modestly confident, charming, polished, and very funny. My close friends would say, if I were a brand, I would represent honesty, integrity, and commitment. If I were asked what I perceived to be my strengths, they would include, being a great communicator two ears, one mouth, a great planner, yet spontaneous. I am both a hard and smart worker, I have accomplished every childhood goal .
