Sometimes I\u2019m quiet when I first meet people as I try to get a read on them. By nature, I am an instigator so it\u2019s helpful to know my friends boundaries beforehand. I blush way too easily, which is not a trait I\u2019m fond of. I also jump around a lot during conversations as I tend to change threads with whatever pops into my head at the moment. Up for outdoors activities in any weather, but heat is my first preference. My interests include the following: trail biking, camping, the drive-in, diverse cultures, hiking, mac and cheese, math, mudding (bike), pushing boundaries (my own and others), shagging fly balls, social commentary, snow spray skiing, strawberry coolattas minus the brain freeze, trail running, trampolines, thunderstorms, and wildlife photography. I consider myself to be fairly-open minded. We all travel different paths in life so I don\u2019t look for matches that have mirror images of my interests or views. I am looking for an intelligent, introspective, emotionally and value both company and solitude.
