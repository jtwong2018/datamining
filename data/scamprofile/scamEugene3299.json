I have millions of blond moments, and love every one of them. I act stupid and retarded, but I can be smart. I hate to argue, but I\u2019m good at it. I am stubborn, but one smile from you and I\u2019ll probably give in. I\u2019m not the thickest man out there, and my hair never goes how I want it to. My face won\u2019t always be perfect, and I sometimes let my emotions rule me. But I promise you, if you gave me a chance, there would never be a man who would love you like me. There would never be a man who would make you laugh as hard as I would, or who would drive you as CRAZY as I would. Sure there will be men prettier, smarter, skinnier then me, but you will never find someone just like me.", "email": " femismith35@yahoo.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "love scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["Eugene32991.jpg", "Eugene32992.jpg"]}
