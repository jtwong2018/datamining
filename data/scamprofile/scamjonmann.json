Of course, it all begins with a great friendship and attraction, but I\u2019ve learned how to get to that next level I think we are all looking for. Keeping a sense of humor, a sense of self, and also a sense of selflessness is all key. But especially humor. I am a creative, intelligent, passionate and outgoing person with a wacky sense of humor. Love my morning coffee, the occasional afternoon nap, anything outdoors when it\u2019s nice out, boating season and a glass of good red wine. listen to music, play tennis, bike and go for walks whenever possible. Keeping life simple, honest, fair, and living with great concern and empathy for others is important to me.", "email": " blazeequipment@outlook.com", "tags": ["Male profiles", "facebook", "romance scammer"], "gender": "male", "images": ["jonmann1.jpg", "jonmann2.jpg"]}
