We usually forget about our soul and just take care of our mind and our body therefore I try to meditate as much as possible since we are souls and should take care of our spiritual progress in the first place. But beside meditating I enjoy gardening, watching a good movie, spending time with my friends, go for a walk etc.\n\r\nI am looking for someone with a pure soul and a big heart. Someone who understands that this life was given to us with a special purpose and we shouldn't waste it.", "match_age": "from 29 to 38", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Spiritual", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Serious Relationship"}
