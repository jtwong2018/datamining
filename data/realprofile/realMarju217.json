I consider myself an extrovert because I can mingle with different kinds of people. On the other hand, I have my alone moments now that I am semi-retired. I spend a lot of time teaching myself the intricacies of the computer and browsing the internet for different positive and self-improvement videos especially when the pandemic started. \r\nI don't believe in love at first sight. I think friendship is the best foundation for a relationship. Ideally, my partner would be someone who is God-fearing, intelligent, decent man with good values; with good sense of humor, and has time for me; one with whom I can hold hands with while walking on the beach to watch the sunset. Please, no abusive behavior! \r\nYou may write to me if you want to gain a new friend from my side of the globe.", "match_age": "from 58 to 66", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
