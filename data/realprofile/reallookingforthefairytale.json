That is the nice way of saying I am a little strange. I find things funny that others may not. I speak fluent sarcasm with a construction worker dialect. I am dark but my heart is not hard. I enjoy every aspect of life. Even the bad days are not all bad. I think everyday that I wake up is a good day. My hobbies are camping, reading and listening to music. All kinds of music. It touches my soul. Don't be surprised to see me dancing in the grocery store or singing in public places. I am a no drama mama!
