I love making presents to those I love and to surprise my dearest and nearest people in a good way, of course. I appreciate the beauty in everything: in people, in love, in nature, in the world around us, in arts, simply, in everything. I am also convinced that we have to accept other people just in a way they are, with their good sides and their flaws, because it is what they call pure and unconditional love.", "match_age": "from 50 to 80", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "occasional drinker", "intent": "Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
