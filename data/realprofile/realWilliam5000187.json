I'm looking forward to becoming the man I'm capable of being and am in search of a woman that it would mean enough to them knowing that they are giving someone else the strength, or at least knowing that their support is greatly contributing to that person's ability to overcome and achieve success to make them want to reasonabley assess a person, believe in them and stand by their side.", "match_age": "from 25 to 50", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Spiritual", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Serious Relationship"}
