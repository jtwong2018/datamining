I am new to this dating/friendship thing. Fortunately, I was aware of this site and scammers so I knew where not to go. I am looking to meet people and make friends around the world and locally if possible. Maybe I will find someone special maybe not but it is more important to have friends and someone to converse with than I do now. I did not realize how small my world had become until I escaped. Now, I look forward to the new life I am recreating and the joy I have in regrowing a new garden along with a new life and friendships. I am a Paramedic and I teach high schoolers to be EMT's which can be a daunting task during the COVID times as I call them. I also deployed to NYC last March for 60 days. That was an adventure but not one I care to repeat. I figure at this point in life I am beyond the point of playing games with anyone. If you want to know more or would like to know more just ask. Like I tell my students I can be very blunt but you will never hear a lie.", "match_age": "from 38 to 63", "children": "1-2 living with me", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Spiritual", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "occasional drinker", "intent": "Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship"}
