I've got tattoos, scars, piercings (all in the head reqion.)\r\nI'm a smidge of a nerd, I loooooove Anime/ manga, like most marvel movies, enjoy writing, being on the computer, walking, swimming.

So if that\u2019s not your thing I appreciate your time but probably won\u2019t work.\n\r\n....\r\nI just want to put out there again that I'm rather shy and don't have much experience in the dating scene. I'm not looking for hookups (there are some sites just for that.) Wish to meet people and maybe make a connection. \r\nSo looking for a nice guy I connect with maybe have some things in common with. Whose patient and a cutie wouldn't hurt.:p\r\nI tend to be attracted to the type of guys who wouldn't be into me...
