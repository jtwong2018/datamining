After numerous catfishing attempts Ive almost written off dating as Its been more than annoying. I don't claim to be someone I am not. I am very noble and caring and I am quirky. I like looking everything up, blogging about whatever pops up, DIY projects and funny movies. My serious side enjoys classical music and symphony, I don't drink or smoke ciggarettes, Id enjoy a glass of wine with my lady, but thats the extent, so please co ciggys. Pot I can deal with if its discrete and medicinal. I cook, clean and I am fully vaccinated as well as my dog. I am not a player type I am too quirky, kind of a nerd, have a history hasn't been kind too me, but the present has been a blessing and the future is bright.", "match_age": "from 33 to 43", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
