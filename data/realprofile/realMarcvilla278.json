I am a 41 single Mexican-American male! I'm just going to get right to the point. I believe myself to be a catch. I never been married and have no children. I don't have an ex-girlfriend. I don't smoke. I do drink every once in a while but I am no alcoholic. I don't do drugs. I never been in jail or am a fugitive on the run. And to those single ladies out there who want their potential guy to be handsome with a great body who makes lots of money, don't even bother talking to me! I don't like to play games and I don't want my time wasted. I'm getting too old for all that. I'm simple. As for my potential significant other, I'm looking for a woman who will love me for me! For me to meet someone nice who comes from a good family (not a perfect family because there's no such thing) For her to be beautiful on the outside as well as the inside. A woman who wants a man who will treat her like a Queen. If you're her, make yourself seen. You want to find out more about me, give me a chance.", "match_age": "from 26 to 40", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Other", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship"}
