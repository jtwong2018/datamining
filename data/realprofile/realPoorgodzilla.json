Self sufficient, and wheelchair bound, someone not in need of babying or being taken care of like an invalid. Someone looking for genuine love and affection, sincere attraction, mutual marital intentions. I'm looking for a personality like mine, a Libra (Horoscope) speaking, and wanting to meet quickly. I've spent so much time searching, so forgive me if I come across as desperate for wanting to not waste so much time getting to know each other in correspondence. I prefer face to face for really getting to know someone. I believe you learn more faster, get impressions, and feelings or attraction indications. I'm not one to expect intimacy right away, in fact I find it just complicates the reason for dating, to find that forever lover. I'm looking for that person that knows themselves well, and knows instantly if the first meeting had a future or not, someone who can determine if the person they meet is up to their standards. Not someone they could make or train to be their ideal mate. Children are welcome, and I would welcome someone wanting to have children, I just don't know if it is possible based on many variables. Age, ability, other factors. Hoping to be married within a six months to a year, only because being at this for so long, and having not many years left to enjoy sharing with someone. I'm old fashioned in many ways.", "match_age": "from 19 to 65", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "occasional drinker", "intent": "Marriage"}
