I dont ask for much, just a happy person whom loves life and doesn't blame other for personal problems. This is your life - live it. \n\r\nI have a dry sense of humour, loves to laugh and get thru my days with being happy. I try to stay healthy butting getting old is getting old. \n\r\nI am financially stable, do not do drama and love to travel. I work part time at a golf course in the summer months and used to travel in the winters before the Chinese flu hit the world! Australia is my favourite destination but enjoy exploring new countries. Ireland is one I would like to visit as my family tree is tied to this country!\n\r\nLook forward to hearing from you.\r\nTim", "match_age": "from 48 to 59", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "social smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
