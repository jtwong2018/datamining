Though I live in the US I am of direct Barbadian descent. For clarification, LTR means Long Term Relationship. BBW means Big Beautiful Woman. I am black and wear a size 18-20. I am thick and curvy. And apparently, I needed to expressly state that you must be unattached or not otherwise involved in another relationship. You must be single and emotionally available for an adult loving relationship. \n\r\nYou must be at least 5-foot 8-inches tall. You must be drug-free, disease free, drama free, have all of your teeth, and a non-smoker (of any kind) in exchange for the same. I am not looking for a one-night stand; I am not into multiple partners.\n\r\nGod has played a cruel joke on women over 50 by giving us a healthy sexual appetite when men of similar age have a sexual appetite that is on the decline. However, I refuse to rob the cradle. I am smart, witty, full of innuendos. Love to make my man smile.
