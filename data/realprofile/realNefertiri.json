Yes my name is Islam in origin,but I have been a Christian for 8 yrs now! Due to this,I have been disinherited by family,friends and community. I live with an elderly lady and spend most days alone...even weekends! Yearning to have a partner who will except me with all my flaws. I do not have time to waste on jokers!!! I am loyal,trustworthy,honest and love hard and deep!!! Yes I am a \"happy chappy\" everyday...but do not mistake my kindness for weakness! I have survived much,so face any challenge head-on...for nothing scares me! Had my fair share of 'scammer exposure' and long for honest seekers of companions...not guys pretending to be someone else to amuse himself!", "match_age": "from 19 to 86", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "light smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
