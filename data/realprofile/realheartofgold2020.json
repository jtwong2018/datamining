I have a very fragile heart that loves unconditionally, so i would love to be with someone who share same too. Love is the most beautiful thing when you get to share it with someone who have same understanding and emotions just like I do. I am at a point in my life where all i want is to be with the woman that will be my lover and partner. Just like Romeo and Juliet, Bonny and Clide, I want to live side by side for ever with her, ;loving her the best way i can, treat her in ways a King will do for his Queen, Shower her with love and affections. Kiss her when she is sad and make her understand tough days don't last but tough people do, go on a cruise with her, travel the world with her, cook with her and bath with her, eat in a restaurant outside ones in a while with her, swim with her, fish with her, go to the movies with her and do absolutely everything with her. I am romantic at heart and my late father before his death taught me to always love and respect women because women are gifts sent by God from heaven to man here on earth, Women are golden therefore i will try as much as i can to love, care , respect and treat whoever i get to be in a relationship with so much love that she will have no reason to cry but smile for the rest of her life.", "match_age": "from 45 to 86", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Other", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
