I am ready to get married and build a family along with my soulmate. So, I hope to find it here. I am not a materialistic woman, so do not try to impress me with your bank account number. I have self-respect and value myself and the good person I am. I hate lies and value loyalty and sincerity. I am a professional translator-interpreter graduated from the University. Believe it or not, I wear a prosthesis in one of my legs due to an accident as a child. So, if you don't mind it, you can write me and I will be glad to read you and see what can emerge. Warm Regards from my humble Cuban heart.", "match_age": "from 32 to 48", "children": "want children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Other", "smoking": "light smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
