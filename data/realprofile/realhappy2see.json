But it\u2019s not a great recommendation for me to tell you about myself, why don\u2019t you contact me and find out for yourself. \r\nI like to have fun and avoid uncomfortable situations. I am divorced and like to think I\u2019m a fun-loving guy with good sense of humour and probably a fragile heart. So if you\u2019re a flirt or a player please keep looking, I\u2019m not interested thanks all the same. \r\nMy original country is Australia but I spend as fair bit of time in the Philippines these days. I travel quite often and love meeting new people and exploring new places and new cultures.", "match_age": "from 30 to 50", "children": "don't want children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Other", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship"}
