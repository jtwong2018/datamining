Opening the door isn\u2019t something that is dead, and flowers aren\u2019t just for Valentine\u2019s Day or special occasions. Winning the heart of the woman you love doesn\u2019t end with marriage, it\u2019s an almost daily occurrence. I believe good manners and grammar still matter, even in texts. I try to live by the golden rule \u201ctreat others the way you want to be treated,\u201d but I am not perfect. I love road trips and looking forward to travel around the country. I\u2019m retired Navy and have been to 19 countries, and have plan on increasing that number. I have three grown children and three grandsons I just adore. So I\u2019m looking forward to them being old enough to travel with me. \n\r\nI enjoy the quietness of living in the country. My town doesn\u2019t even have a stop sign on the road going through it. I grew up in Detroit and was stationed in a few big cities. I just don\u2019t like city living anymore. I\u2019d describe myself as a pretty average guy. I\u2019m only 5ft 8in, so I\u2019m not too tall, definitely wish I was taller; I think that\u2019s why I like my cowboy boots. I have three grown children and three grandsons I love to death. \n\r\nI\u2019m looking for my best friend, confidant, and lover. Someone who I just enjoy being with no matter what we are doing. A person who just automatically glides next to me as we walk and we naturally just grab each other\u2019s hand. My faith plays a part in my life, and would be a part of any relationship that I have. I enjoy going to church with the person I\u2019m seeing. I\u2019m Christian and go to a nondenominational church. I learned that having a similar basic belief structure just made for a stronger relationship. I\u2019ve seen a lot of liberals say they want nothing to do with conservatives, so just to be forthcoming I am a conservative. Well that\u2019s about it for now, I\u2019ll add more as I think of it.\n\r\nIf you have only one picture, or only pictures with filters I probably won\u2019t reply.", "match_age": "from 19 to 86", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
