A real woman. A real love. A real life in what time is left to me.\n\r\nIf you'd be willing to meet face to face instead of chatting or messaging here, there would be a chance.\n\r\nThree things that kill any attempt at starting a real relationship with me are these:\n\r\n1) asking for money\r\n2) sending nude photos by email\r\n3) not being willing to meet face to face in a public, safe place.\n\r\nI'm not bitter or angry, as some of the women seem to think, just cautious since I was scammed back in 2017 trying to find that one real woman.\n\r\nI've said in before but no one seems to hear:\r\nfinding real love isn't like searching for a needle in a haystack - - -\n\r\nit's like searching for a needle in a haystack size pile of needles and finding love is like finding that one 'golden' needle in a pile of needles as big as the haystacks in fairy tales.", "match_age": "from 36 to 59", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Spiritual", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
