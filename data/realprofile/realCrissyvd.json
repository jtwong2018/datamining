I am a BBW which means I am a big beautiful woman and yes with lots of flaws and three beautiful grown up kids and two grandchildren. I\u2019d like first to apologize for the typos I might have\u2026 I must confess I\u2019m Afrikaans (I know\u2026 nobody\u2019s perfect) and I\u2019m pretty much new to dating sites. I thought I would throw some keywords that would describe what I like to do. If you recognize yourself in some of them, I think it might be worth taking the time to keep on reading my profile. If you don\u2019t keep on reading, I swear I won\u2019t be upset with you. I will never know anyway. Surprises, music, dancing, soccer, last minute plans, open mind, craziness, spontaneity, going out (but also staying in), sharing, simplicity, respect, flip flops (yes, the sandals), down to earth (however fantasy is also very important), people, casual, word, news, work, sense of humor about yourself, awareness. And yet another short list of things that I\u2019m not fond of: \u2013 Self-centered people (but, hey\u2026 Have you ever heard anybody saying \u201cyes, yes, I am definitely self-centered?\u201d So, this one doesn\u2019t really count!!) \u2013 TV (even if I like one or two shows and some movies) \u2013 Superficial people (but same problem as 1\u2026) In addition, if you happen to pronounce the following sentences regularly, we\u2019re definitely increasing the chance of a good match here: \u201cOk let\u2019s give it a try\u201d \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know\u201d \u201cI respect that\u201d And last (I promise), if you think that Paris is the most beautiful city in the world, I think you should tell our parents to get ready for the wedding lol I am crazy, stupid, and charming.NOW THAT I\u2019VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION\u2026\u2026. You\u2019re dealing with the ultimate lady. No matter what happens, at the end of the day I\u2019ll make you smile, laugh, and wonder, \u201cHow come I\u2019ve never met a girl like this before??!!\u201dI love to listen to rnb music as I relax on my couch. I I hate it when men are \u201cDROP DEAD HANDSOME\u201d on the outside and \u201cDROP DEAD GARBAGE\u201d on the inside.I loooove to sing Luther Vandross songs. Also, I would love to be blessed with the man/friend of my life. Want to know more??? Well, that can\u2019t happen unless you contact me. Hate playing games??!! Hate being told lies??!! Well, come on\u2026I\u2019M YOUR WOMAN!!!YOU NEED THIS in your life!!! PEACE & BLESSINGS!!! You still haven\u2019t messaged me yet??!! LET\u2019S GO\u2026CHOP, CHOP!!!!
