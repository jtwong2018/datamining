I know who I am and am comfortable in my skin. Heredity has been kind to me. I'm intuitive, empathic and different from most other women in my interests and pursuits. For instance, I'm excited about tiny house design, alternative power that doesn't involve solar or wind, and I hate shopping.\n\r\nIn no particular order, I love cooking, working out, trying new foods, beautiful scenery, art, music, movies (action-adventure, sci-fi, and chick flicks), talking on a variety of subjects, sunrises in summer, sunsets all year, waking up when I feel ready, brainstorming, dreaming and planning, holding hands (yes, in public), hugs and kisses (and sex).\n\r\nI discuss instead of arguing. You're entitled to your feelings and your perspective. I'm sensitive and intuitive... no drama or conflict. I enjoy time alone, but not to the point of being lonely. I prefer to be with someone most of the time.\n\r\nI love my critters (2 dogs, 2 cats). I love being retired.\n\r\nI'm direct and don't play games. If you want to know something, ask -- I don't bite. I like to laugh, but not at the expense of others.\n\r\nI'm a toucher, hugger, and snuggler. I'm looking for the same in a man. I'm here for a friend, lover, and true partner. I'm here for someone who wants the long-haul, not a fling. I'm here for the love of my life for the rest of my life.", "match_age": "from 50 to 70", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Other", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
