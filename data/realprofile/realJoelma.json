I am so done with the fake profile, either you want a good woman in your life or you don\u2019t!????!! I am your Honest, Fun Loving, Upfront & Down to Earth Kinda Person. NO time for Playing Games and PLEASE No Lies & No DRAMA, I AM DEFINITELY TOO OLD FOR THAT!! I am interested in getting to know you first and developing a friendship with possibly developing into a relationship if things progress to that?? Just to give you a little 'Snipet' for now, anything more I will be willing to let you know if we both share the same interests.\n\r\nI'm an extroverted introvert so i do sometimes need alone time to recover from the world. I like all types of music with the exception of Rap!
