No need to rush in to anything but I am not looking to just hook up either. I am not looking for someone to text forever and I don't need to go to another place to message like hangouts or WhatsApp Right here is fine until we exchchange phone numbers or whatever. Nobody has a working phone on dating sites for talking or video chat ? Amazing! If your profile picture is someone besides you (amature porn star or Instagram model) please don't contact me. I am also not willing to do a long distance relationship with someone that is an unreasonable distance away a few hours is fine but across the country or overseas I am not doing that .\r\nI work for myself and I am single, never married with no kids. I have a very dark sense of humor and think being cynical is funny which gives the impression I have a negative attitude which could not be further from the truth I think I am hilarious. Is that wrong? I do not like negative people or people who have anger management issues. There is never a reason to behave in such negative ways and I immediately separate myself from those type of people I am an animal lover especially dogs, \r\nI like pizza, nachos, motorcycles rock and roll especially ounk rock , old cars, road trips and the outdoors, I am a life long vegetarian and I don't care if anyone else is or isn't one.", "match_age": "from 28 to 86", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Other", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
