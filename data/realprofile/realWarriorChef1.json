I've never been married, no kids. Graduated from UGA in 1998. I am an easy going professional Chef that wants to slow down a little, take my time to smell the roses and spend time in the company of a lady. I like cooking of course, visiting with friends, tv, movies, UGA football, hunting, fishing, camping and the shooting sports. I like exploring natural forests, container gardening and shows at the local theaters and The Fox in Atlanta. I have a wide spectrum of things I like to do. I am looking for a FWB, that shares similar interests, for fun inside and outside the bedroom and I can share my secrets with, an accomplice. I\u2019m an open book, ask me anything.", "match_age": "from 19 to 50", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Spiritual", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship"}
