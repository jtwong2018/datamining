It's my purpose in life to share love, peace and joy. I'm spiritually centered and have daily practices, including meditation and yoga. I also happen to be intelligent, educated, articulate, kind, generous in spirit, adventurous and open-minded. I love nature, especially any bodies of water. I'm looking for a like-minded man to settle down with, hopefully marriage. He must be committed to self-improvement/evolving of soul, as well as to health and fitness. I really want to be able to meditate with my partner!
