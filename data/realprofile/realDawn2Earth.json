If we can''t be friends first, we can''t be anything. I believe that by starting as friends, which in itself is a huge gift, it takes a lot of pressure off of 2 people. If something should grow and develop from that, it will come as a surprise.\r\nIF and when it does happen....\r\nI want a MUTUAL relationship. One not dominating over the other.\r\nHe will walk beside me. The only way I walk behind a man is if the view is good.\n\r\nA few things to know about me... I''m not half, I''m already whole. I don''t need someone to complete me. I''m already a person. Don''t rescue me.... I rescued myself a long time ago. Don''t try to fix me. I''m not broken. Thanks!\n\r\nI''m passionate about my career choice. Some may call me a \"workaholic\", but how can that be when I LOVE what I do? Plant Medicine and helping people, animals, Mother Earth....my passions.\n\r\n***NOTE: FIESTY runs in my family.
