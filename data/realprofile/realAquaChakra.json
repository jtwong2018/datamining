I am not looking for anyone that doesn't live anywhere remotely close to the desert**\n\r\nI am sympathetic, charitable, genial, unassuming, visionary, intuitive, and have a subtle sense of humor. I don't belong to any particular religious sect, due to a need to find my own path and experience truth for myself. At times I do enjoy volunteering to help less fortunate individuals. I love nature and animals, especially horses. I feel a connection to the yoUniverse as a whole, and feel a rapport with all living creatures.\n\r\nI love the colorful, the beautiful, the musical, and the magical. I am attracted to metaphysics and want to innerstand the deeper truths of life. I am very artistic as well. I enjoy writing short stories, poetry, songs, painting, sculpting, crafting jewelry, and singing.\n\r\nI am upright, moral and have a well-defined sense of ethics. I have a strong respect for honesty in others. I enjoy learning things that involve nutrition, natural healing, astrology and psychology.
