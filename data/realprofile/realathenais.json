I am beautiful, sensual, yet classy and playful. I have lived and loved, I have experienced great joy and great sorrow. Although a widow, it does not define me. I learn from my past and love with great faithfulness. I am a very proud mother, an adult daughter, and love my family. I have the gift of instruction, as I teach in my profession.\r\nMy hobbies are varied but fulfilling, ranging from preparing fine dishes to eat, or embroidering creative designs. Travel is one of my favorite activities, and it is something I wish to do more of. I live a very healthy lifestyle, and have absolutely zero addictions. I am strictly a one man kind of woman...faithful, loyal amd honest to a fault. I try to see the best in people, but am not easily fo\r\nI seek a man that understands the words: monogamy, loyalty, faithfulness and honesty and respect. A man that also had raised a family is best, and a man that embraces a healthy lifestyle with no addictions. He must love to explore, travel is one of his hobbies, and being heslthy, keeps his body in top form, as I do. Above all, he seeks a true, lasting, long-term relationship that hopefully lasts a lifetime. I do NOT seek a pen friend, text buddy or sexting partner. Immaturity is not attractive. Let us build from a wonderful friendship that goes right into a loving and exciting life together!", "match_age": "from 19 to 86", "children": "1-2 living with me", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Serious Relationship"}
