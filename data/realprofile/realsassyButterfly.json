I prefer single men, 35 and older, lives in austin and surrounding metro areas\r\n. and not looking for anything serious. Someone who can respect a lady. \r\nPlease be mindful...I am a lady therefore need to get to trust you before I will meet with you. Also I don't give out my phone number till I'm ready to do so, so please be respectful...dating sites are here to meet people and chat on here for the time being.\r\nI love watching movies especially classics. I love to listen to classic rock and the old music.\r\nI enjoy playing darts and billiards. There's a lot more about me but if I tell all now, there wouldn't be much to talk about except daily rituals. So send me a message and we can go from there. Thanks for stopping by and have a wonderful day.
