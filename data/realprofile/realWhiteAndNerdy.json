Drink rarely, smoke routinely, eat bacon often, live on caffeine. Collector of pointless facts and surface-level understanding of many, many topics. Love a good conversation, especially if we can challenge each other.\n\r\nSmart is sexy, talk nerdy to me... just don't expect me to understand Klingon. Picard over Kirk... but my favorite captain will always be Sam Carter.\n\r\nIf you're honest, a little funny and you can hold up your end of the conversation we'll do just fine. I'm a tactile person though and intimacy is definitely on my list of best things. If you like snuggling in front of a movie, holding hands in public, spooning, casual contact when we pass in the kitchen, cuddles after sex, being really close to someone just because... talk to me. If not, maybe I'm not what you're looking for. I'm not just here for NSA or FWB - I'm looking for more than that.\n\r\nI'm young at heart and am told I don't look (or act) my age. I can do serious, just not all the time please.\n\r\nAnd if you can't show an honest photo on your profile, why are you even here? Turn off the stupid filters, show us the real you. Take of the sunglasses and let us see your eyes. Show me the lines you get when you smile, they're part of who you are. Be real, or be a disappointment. We all have imperfections. Only cartoon characters and fake people are flawless, and neither of those are attractive.", "match_age": "from 30 to 52", "children": "1-2 living elsewhere", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Atheist", "smoking": "light smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Fun, Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship"}
