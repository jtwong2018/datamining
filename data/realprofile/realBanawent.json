They're one of the greatest joys in my world. I am also a huge family person. I consider myself an artsy person and photography is a huge passion. I love the outdoors, fishing and hiking. I do love to travel. My favorite places to go are New York and Colorado. I have traveled outside of the states and would love to go back.
