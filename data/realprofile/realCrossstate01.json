I am actually here to make a real friend of the same gender , i am trying to find exactly that person we all believe it is out there that when you finally meet them , you dont have to try to connect things together or try to be reliable because it will all follow a natural course , that friend . To start riots with secret cults escape to another country , or just have tea and play late night table tennis and threat everyone with their lives that threatens that of your friend , a friend who you share with each others secrets and dreams and basically exist in expression through them because they want it , sharing doing things together , and absolutely nothing bad is to be expected from because they are real just as you are . And who knows maybe you can do great things with in life if its meant . Id like to start it with tea and table tennis and just mandatory throwing our selves at each others shelter room or house , maybe you live in a van , i couldnt care less haha ^_^ . I accept any kind of normal or freak as long as they have strength to be good and trusted . Major matter in my life is , i believe in the messiah and i am christian i pray and i am very self experienced and i dont fit in absolutely anything around , i am living all in from me to god from god to me .
