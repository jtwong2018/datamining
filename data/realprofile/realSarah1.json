I'm not looking forward to dating again, especially on the Internet. But I can see that this could be a good way to learn about someone in a much shorter time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\r\nI've always been a passionate, loyal and devoted with strong family values and high moral standards \u00a0with a great sense of humor ,intelligent and very understanding ,hardworking ,and also a good cook.i took interest in cooking from my mom .I have learn to stay in the kitchen while she cooks.Perhaps growing up with mom as taught me so much of how man can be treated in the place they so desire .I am a loyal, fun, outgoing person. I don't like games . Just be honest, it saves a lot of time.\n\r\nAbout me: I guess I am best described as contradictory and diverse. Adventurous yet stable. Fun yet reliable. Hard worker yet not a workaholic. Funny with a serious side. Active yet relaxed. In shape, but up for staying in. Communicative yet thoughtful. And chivalry is not dead.And of course romantic! I am comfortable with who I am and am established in a good career.I like to stay reasonably active by going to the gym, swimming, tennis, basketball, hiking, walking, or bicycling.", "match_age": "from 45 to 65", "children": "no children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "occasional drinker", "intent": "Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
