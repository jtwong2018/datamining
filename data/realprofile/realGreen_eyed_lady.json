I have been blessed and I like to stay in the positive. I work in the finance sector and have owned some businesses, so I have an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\r\nI am very open and honest and have no interest in playing games. A true geek at heart, I love learning and researching and enjoy exploring \"fringe\" topics of conversation.\n\r\nI have a great love for travel. It does not have to be wildly exotic or expensive, I get enjoyment from simply going somewhere I have never been even if nearby. I believe every place has unique and worthwhile qualities that most overlook.\n\r\nI love reading, movies, binge watching netflix and simple card games. The activity does not matter so much as the company.\n\r\nI play bass guitar and drums. I think it would be great fun to have someone to jam with. Rock on!!\n\r\nI am looking for a God-sent partner to share in life's adventures... big and small.
