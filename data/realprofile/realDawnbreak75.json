I often go to Vegas to visit family.\n\r\nI WOULD BE IN VEGAS THIS APRIL.\n\r\nI'm a graduate of a medical course but ended up in the field of education.\n\r\nI belong to a big family but we are all independent from each other.\n\r\nI love pets since I used to have one when I was a kid. It is just that I was broken hearted when I lost him (Champ). \n\r\nI developed a new hobby since the pandemic and that is \"plants\". So, I am into it when I have the time. \n\r\nI'm more of a homebody person. I go out once in a while with friends. \n\r\nI'm looking for someone who would complement with me as I complement with him. I am a devout Christian and it is important to me to have someone who shares my faith. I'm more of the conservative type so I am easily taken aback with aggressive personality. \n\r\nOn the weekends, I'm usually at home. (I also work from home) Unless there are some gatherings or meetings to attend.\n\r\nMovies that I like are Shawshank Redemption, Primal Fear, or I can also be Mushy like Sweet November, The Notebook and be childish and nostalgic with Disney and Pixar Movies. \n\r\nI love listening to music that is why there is always music in my house playing, unless of course I'm working or sleeping. \n\r\nMy friends are asking why I am not married. I also don't know. I believe I haven't met the one for me yet.", "match_age": "from 46 to 55", "children": "1-2 living with me", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "never", "intent": "Friendship, Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
