I have Asperger's, I'm a nerd in many ways, and I'm a deeply spiritual person. No specific religion, but closest to Paganism. I have a multitude of interests and love to talk. I don't put up with rude, insulting, disrespectful people at all. I just want a nice clean, respectful, intelligent conversation to start with and go from there. My sense of humor is almost entirely family friendly and I like to try and make friends. No car, and I don't have much money, but I support myself with no problem for now. If you're looking for money don't talk to me. As long as you're financially okay that's good. I'm a caring, respectful person and I expect the same from everyone else.
