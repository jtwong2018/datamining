I enjoy the company of others of like minds, around me. I get my thrills in finance. I love to play the stock market. The bulls gives a quick rush, the bears keep me pumping. My only other wish is that she be there besides me, to share my joy and excitement; a fulfilling thrilling experience. What takes your place are my 80's and 90's music videos. I love to compose music and edit music videos. I like Pro photography, but I am really bad at it. I would love to play an instrument, but I don't know how to. I have a synthesizer, a violin, and a set of electric drums, but I only stare at them in wonder; all I am missing is the Electric Guitar and the cast. A cat comes over to visit me every day so that I can pet her and giver some tasty goodies, and then she is gone. I don't know who she belongs to, but she seeks me out. All though I love the pussy's attention, I wish it were the girl of my dreams instead, the real thing. What I think about me? I think I am a cool dude. What I think about you? I think you are missing me in your life.", "match_age": "from 21 to 45", "children": "want children", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Spiritual", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Romance, Serious Relationship, Marriage"}
