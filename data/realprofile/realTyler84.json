I'm very determined and ambitious. An entrepreneur and business owner since I was 18 years old. I pretty recently had given up on women as I've not been able to find one who can be honest and communicate, and who is also mature. I've researched my family tree on Ancestry.com and found much of my roots originate in Niedersachsen, Lower Saxony, Germany. I find it fascinating to have discovered this, and would be happy to meet a woman from Germany to potentially start something such as friendship, romance, dating, and possibly one day marriage. Please, I'm only on here for real and sincere women who are interested in the same !
