I rent a nice little cozy house off Beach Blvd; 3 sheds (yes, one a silly manacle I started a year ago), two tiny dogs gf left when went to Mexico to be with her daughter, husband and grandchildren. Wasn't a typical break-up situation at all but very hard on me financially/ responsibility-wise. Was a professional actor, writer and musician for many years prior to iron-work. ASK SAY as I believe it BEST! NO holds barred ever! Why move forward then discover 'opposition' 6 months or 2 years later?
