When I do, and I'm not sleeping, I usually read, write, watch tv series, play guitar/ukulele or go for a walk on the hills (we live near the Pyrenees moutains) with my son/dog/cat... whoever follows.\r\nIt's my first time writing a serious online profile and it's quite a boring exercise... or maybe I'm just not very good at it.", "match_age": "from 23 to 43", "children": "1-2 living with me", "orientation": "Straight", "religion": "Christian", "smoking": "non-smoker", "drinking": "social drinker", "intent": "Friendship"}
