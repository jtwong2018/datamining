Nothing special. Looking for a loving, kind, patient, understanding and playful woman to be my \"reason\". I enjoy cinema (especially Asian and Classic). Like most types of music, but my favorite is Korean. At first, I might come across shy and cautious, but once I am comfortable, playful and loving. I tend to speak my mind and am quite honest. I prefer to cuddle, make love and laugh/joke...then fight, argue or play games with people. But, I will also stand up for what I believe and those I care about.
